# Service Area Audit & Recommendations: Lancaster Law Group

## 1. Executive Summary
This document provides an audit of the service areas for **Lancaster Law Group** (110 E King St, Lancaster, PA 17602) and outlines recommendations for optimizing the Google Business Profile (GBP) service area settings. The goal is to align the digital footprint with the firm's operational capabilities, focusing on high-population and high-proximity areas to maximize local search visibility.

## 2. Current Configuration Audit
*   **Current Status:** The provided resources (screenshot of Address settings) do not show an active "Service area" list. This typically indicates either:
    *   No specific service areas are defined (relying solely on the physical address radius).
    *   The service area list was not captured in the current view.
*   **Assessment:** If no service areas are explicitly set, the profile acts as a standard storefront. Explicitly defining service areas (cities/counties) is recommended to signal relevance to users searching from nearby towns (e.g., "lawyer near Lititz").

## 3. Geographic Analysis
*   **Location:** Downtown Lancaster (Penn Square area).
*   **Target Market:** The firm is centrally located to serve the entirety of Lancaster County.
*   **Strategy:** Prioritize "Core" areas (Lancaster City and immediate suburbs) for highest conversion likelihood, then "Secondary" areas (larger boroughs within 15-20 minutes).

## 4. Recommendations
Based on the analysis of population density and proximity to `Lancaster, PA`, the following service areas are recommended for addition to the Google Business Profile.

### Criteria Used:
*   **Proximity:** Prioritized ZIP codes within a ~15-mile radius of downtown Lancaster.
*   **Population:** Prioritized highest population density to maximize reach.
*   **Rationale:** Demographic and simplified geographic context for prioritization.
