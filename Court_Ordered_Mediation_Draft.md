# Court-Ordered Mediation in Arizona

**Fulfill Your Court Mandate with a Trusted, Experienced Mediation Provider**

If an Arizona court has ordered you to attempt mediation before proceeding to trial, you're not alone. **Court-ordered mediation** is a standard requirement in most Arizona family law cases, particularly those involving child custody, parenting time, and post-decree disputes. At The Aurit Center for Divorce Mediation, we help court-referred families meet their legal obligations while still achieving meaningful, child-focused resolutions.

## Understanding Court-Ordered Mediation in Arizona

**Court-ordered mediation** is the process by which an Arizona judge mandates that disputing parties work with a **neutral mediator** to attempt resolution *before* a contested hearing. Under **Rule 68 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure**, judges have broad authority to order mediation in cases involving:

*   Child custody and legal decision-making
*   Parenting time disputes
*   Modifications to existing parenting plans
*   Child support and spousal maintenance disagreements
*   Property division conflicts

This is different from voluntary mediation. When mediation is court-ordered, parties are **legally required to participate in good faith**. Failure to comply with a court order can result in **sanctions**, **adverse rulings**, or being held in **contempt**.

## Why Arizona Courts Order Mediation

Arizona's family court system is designed to keep families out of prolonged, adversarial litigation whenever possible. **Rule 67.3 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure** establishes mediation as a **confidential**, protected process. Judges order mediation because it:

### Reduces Court Backlog
Keeps contested hearings off the court calendar, allowing judges to focus on cases that genuinely require judicial intervention.

### Prioritizes Children's Well-Being
Encourages parents to cooperate and make decisions together, which is shown to produce better outcomes for children than judge-imposed orders.

### Promotes Durable Agreements
Parents who create their own agreements are statistically more likely to follow them long-term, reducing repeat court filings.

### Lowers Family Costs
Mediation is significantly less expensive than a contested trial, preserving family resources for the children.

## What Happens in Court-Ordered Mediation?

When you are referred to The Aurit Center by the court, you can expect a structured, professional process:

1.  **Intake & Scheduling**: We contact both parties to schedule the mediation session(s) within the court's required timeframe.
2.  **Pre-Mediation Review**: You provide relevant documents (existing orders, parenting plans, financial disclosures) so the mediator is prepared.
3.  **Mediation Sessions**: You meet with your mediator—virtually or in person—to discuss the disputed issues. The mediator facilitates communication and helps identify solutions.
4.  **Agreement Drafting**: If you reach an agreement, we prepare a legally compliant document ready for court approval.
5.  **Reporting to the Court**: Whether or not you reach full agreement, we provide the required documentation to the court confirming your participation and compliance.

## Legal Benefits of Mediation vs. Litigation

Arizona family courts strongly favor mediation for its positive outcomes. Here's how it compares:

| Legal Factor | Mediation | Litigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy** | Confidential; not public record | Filed and argued publicly in court |
| **Control** | You decide the terms | Judge decides outcomes |
| **Timeline** | Usually 2–4 months | Often 12 months or more |
| **Cost** | Flat-fee pricing | High retainers & hourly fees |
| **Compliance** | Parents likely to follow own terms | Lower likelihood of following orders |

## What If We Don't Reach an Agreement?

Not all court-ordered mediations result in a full settlement—and that's okay. Even partial agreements can narrow the issues that need to be litigated, saving you time and money. If no agreement is reached, we provide documentation to the court confirming that you participated in good faith. Your case then proceeds to the scheduled hearing, but you will have met your legal obligation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does "court-ordered mediation" mean in Arizona?
Court-ordered mediation means an Arizona family court judge has required you to attend mediation sessions with a **neutral third party** before your case can proceed to a contested hearing. Under **Rule 68 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure**, judges have broad discretion to order mediation in custody, parenting time, and other family law disputes.

### Am I required to reach an agreement in court-ordered mediation?
No. You are required to **participate in good faith**, but you are not required to agree to anything. If you cannot reach an agreement, your case proceeds to the scheduled hearing or trial. However, any **partial agreements** reached in mediation can still simplify and shorten the litigation process.

### What happens if I refuse to attend court-ordered mediation?
Refusing to comply with a court order is serious. The judge may impose **sanctions**, make **adverse inferences** about your willingness to cooperate, or hold you in **contempt of court**. If you have legitimate safety concerns (e.g., domestic violence history), you should notify the court and request an exemption.

### Is what I say in court-ordered mediation confidential?
Yes. Under **Rule 67.3 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure**, communications made during mediation are **confidential** and generally cannot be used as **evidence in court**. This protection encourages open, honest discussion.

### How quickly can I schedule my court-ordered mediation session?
At The Aurit Center, we prioritize **court-referred cases** and can typically schedule your first session within 1–2 weeks. We work directly with your court's **timeline requirements** to ensure you meet your deadline.
