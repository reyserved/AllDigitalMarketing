| Topic | Blog Posts Found | Recommendation |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Child Support | 3 posts | Consolidate into pillar page |
| Alimony | 3 posts | Consolidate into pillar page |
| Custody | 3+ posts | Consolidate into pillar page |
| Prenup | 1 post | Upgrade to service page |
| High-Asset Divorce | 8+ posts | Strong coverage - optimize existing |

3. **Georgia Divorce Laws** – Dedicated authoritative page

### Phase 4: Optimization (Q3)

## Flagged Issues

### ⚠️ Criminal Practice Pages (High MSV, Off-Topic)

| Page | MSV | Recommendation |
|------|-----|----------------|
| DUI Attorney | 22,200 | Review if practice area is active - massive SEO opportunity |
| Criminal Defense | 5,400 | Review if practice area is active |
| Drug Offense | 720 | Review if practice area is active |

> [!CAUTION]
> These criminal pages have **extremely high search volume** but are outside family law. If TDE Law practices in these areas, they warrant dedicated strategy. If not, consider removing or deprioritizing.

### ⚠️ URL Structure Issues

Many pages use `/family-law/` prefix instead of state-based URLs:
- Current: `/family-law/divorce/`
- Ideal: `/georgia/divorce/`

**Recommendation:** Address in Phase 4 with 301 redirects during site restructure.
