## **H2: What Is Waste-to-Energy?**

Waste-to-energy (WTE) is a way to convert certain **non-recyclable waste** into usable fuel and energy. Instead of sending material to landfill, WTE supports **energy recovery from waste** through controlled handling and **waste energy conversion**.

For many operations, **waste to energy services** are a fit when waste streams are consistent and recycling is not an option. This is especially relevant for **WTE for manufacturers** and commercial facilities that need a repeatable diversion strategy and clearer sustainability reporting.

## **H2: Our Waste-to-Energy Process**

We run **industrial waste-to-energy** programs with a simple, documented workflow.

### **Process Overview (Visual Diagram)**

**1\) Material Assessment**  
 We identify what qualifies and what doesn’t.

* Material type, contamination, and consistency  
* Volume and frequency  
* Current disposal approach and constraints  
* Compliance and documentation needs

**2\) Fuel Preparation**  
 We prepare qualifying waste for consistent conversion.

* Sorting and removal of non-compatible items  
* Size reduction / densification (as needed)  
* Quality checks to stabilize output

**3\) Energy Conversion**  
 We route prepared material to an approved conversion pathway.

* Match the material stream to the right pathway  
* Confirm facility acceptance requirements  
* Coordinate logistics and handling standards

**4\) Sustainability Reporting**  
 We document outcomes your team can use.

* Landfill diversion tracking  
* Energy recovery estimates (where applicable)  
* Documentation for reporting and internal alignment

## **H2: Benefits of WTE**

Converting non-recyclable waste into energy provides a strategic advantage by lowering long-term disposal costs, eliminating landfill dependence, and delivering verifiable sustainability data for your ESG reporting.

* **Reduce Landfill Usage**
    * Divert qualifying waste streams away from landfills to eliminate environmental liability.
* **Support ESG & Reporting**
    * Achieve trackable diversion outcomes with clear documentation to validate your sustainability goals.
* **Lower Long-Term Costs**
    * Reduce overall waste spend based on optimized material types, volumes, and logistics.
* **Capture Material Value**
    * Transform unrecyclable byproducts into a clean energy resource instead of paying to landfill them.

## **H2: Industries Best Fit for WTE**

WTE works best where waste streams are predictable and consistent.

* **Food production:** packaged rejects, off-spec loads, contamination issues  
* **Packaging & plastics:** mixed packaging, contaminated film, rigid scraps  
* **Consumer goods manufacturing:** off-spec products, returns, damaged inventory  
* **Industrial waste generators**: recurring disposal pressure with non-recyclables

## **H2: Case Study — Waste-to-Energy Program for a Food Manufacturer**

A food manufacturer needed to reduce landfill dependence without disrupting production. We assessed the waste stream, confirmed what qualified for WTE, and built a workable program with clear handling steps and reporting.

## **H2: FAQ**

### **What materials qualify for WTE?**

Materials typically qualify when they are non-recyclable, consistent in composition, and acceptable within approved conversion pathways. Eligibility depends on contamination levels, local requirements, and receiving facility standards.

### **Is WTE compliant with environmental regulations?**

Yes. LJP routes material only to permitted, approved facilities and documents acceptance. Compliance depends on the waste type, transportation rules, conversion pathway, and local/state regulations. We build the process around documentation and accepted pathways.

### **How does WTE reduce our landfill usage?**

By diverting qualifying waste from disposal. Instead of landfilling, material is prepared for **waste energy conversion** and tracked as diversion.

**What volumes do we need to get started?**

Programs work best with steady volumes. Minimums and pickup cadence are confirmed during qualification and logistics planning to ensure acceptance and cost efficiency.

**What will our team need to do on site?**

Segregate qualifying materials, use specified containers (e.g., gaylords, carts, compacted bales), label and stage correctly, and keep contaminants out. We provide clear SOPs and training during launch.

### **Start Your Waste-to-Energy Program**

If you’re exploring **waste to energy services**, the best first step is confirming what qualifies and what outcomes are realistic for your waste stream.
