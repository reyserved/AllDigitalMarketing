Variables:
Full NAP Address = 
City Name = 
Primary County Name =
State Abbreviation =
Adjacent County = 

Please list the top 20 ZIP codes by population for [city name] and [primary county name], [state abbreviation]. 

Then, adjust this list to prioritize the 20 ZIP codes closest to [city name] within a 13 mile radius as a starting point. Prioritize closer cities/ZIP codes (e.g., similar to including Butler, WI in a Menomonee Falls query). Finally, expand to include [adjacent county name(s), e.g., Washington County] for a more holistic coverage within the radius, ranking primarily by proximity (distance first) and then by population descending. Provide the results in a markdown table with columns for Rank, ZIP Code, Primary City, County, Approximate Distance (miles), and Population. Use the most recent available data or projections for the current year.
