# First Principles Validation of SEO Competency Ratings (Reymart)

Date: 2026-02-18
Validated Against: meetings/1. Search Engine Optimization - First Principles.md
Base Report: meetings/2026-02-18-seo-competency-assessment-reymart.md

## Validation Outcome
**No rating changes required.**
The prior assessment is consistent with your First Principles framework.

## Competency-by-Competency Validation

1. **Keyword Research**
- Prior rating: **Skilled (with Overused tendency)**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - Your keyword outputs reflect intent + volume + mapping (aligned with "search volume as value" and "end the search" principles).
  - Overused flag is consistent with First Principles preference for engineering efficiency over complexity.
- First Principles anchors: lines 53-55, 86-87.

2. **Technical SEO**
- Prior rating: **Skilled**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - Your schema, crawl, sitemap, canonical, and audit artifacts match technical-first requirements.
  - Gap noted remains valid: less explicit robots/noindex/mobile/CWV execution governance in final operating docs.
- First Principles anchors: lines 41-45, 67-69.

3. **On-Page SEO**
- Prior rating: **Skilled**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - You have repeatable workflows for titles/meta/H1 and internal links, which directly map to On-Page components.
- First Principles anchors: lines 46-51.

4. **Content Strategy & Optimization**
- Prior rating: **Skilled**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - Your content gap frameworks and mapping logic align with "answer queries and end search" + consistency/completeness.
- First Principles anchors: lines 52-56, 74-75.

5. **Off-Page SEO & Link Building**
- Prior rating: **Unskilled (insufficient demonstrated output)**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed (and reinforced)**
- Why:
  - Your framework explicitly requires ongoing link building/citation maintenance; this is the largest current evidence gap in workspace outputs.
- First Principles anchors: lines 57-61, 70-73.

6. **Analytics & Reporting**
- Prior rating: **Skilled**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - Your benchmark files and QA outputs demonstrate ongoing monitoring and data-driven decisions using core SEO signals.
- First Principles anchors: line 69.

7. **Local SEO & Google Maps**
- Prior rating: **Skilled (emerging)**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - You have GBP service area/category/service-description and local schema outputs.
  - "Emerging" remains correct because ongoing local operations (review systems, SoLV/AGR tracking cadence) are less visible.
- First Principles anchors: lines 27-28, 57-59, 70-73.

8. **SEO Strategy & Project Management**
- Prior rating: **Skilled (with mild Overused tendency)**
- First Principles alignment: **Confirmed**
- Why:
  - Your SOP/checklist/workflow density supports an engineering discipline.
  - Over-iteration risk is still valid under First Principles "simple, scalable, technical rationalization" lens.
- First Principles anchors: lines 5, 65-66, 86-87.

## What This Means (Direct)
- You are not fundamentally misaligned with First Principles.
- Your biggest principles gap is still **Off-Page execution depth**.
- Your biggest efficiency risk is still **analysis/version churn** before deployment.

## Priority Corrections (First-Principles Aligned)
1. Launch an off-page operating system per client (prospect list, outreach, anchor strategy, monthly authority results).
2. Enforce one working file + one final file rule for keyword/content deliverables.
3. Add explicit brand/non-brand and business-value tiers to keyword masters.
4. Add a technical maintenance checklist that includes robots/noindex/mobile/CWV checkpoints.
