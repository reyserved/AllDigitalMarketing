# SEO Technical Skill Competency Assessment (Reymart)

Date: 2026-02-18
Rubric: meetings/Copy of SEO Technical Skill Competencies.md

## Scope Scanned
- Scanned deliverable/output files in workspace: **412** files.
- Included formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.md`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.html`, `.txt`, `.json`.
- Excluded from scoring: binary screenshots/images and downloaded web-asset folders (`*_files`) because they do not provide direct competency evidence.

## Overall Summary
You are **performing well overall (mostly Skilled level)** in core SEO execution. Your strongest areas are:
- Keyword research operations and mapping systems
- Technical schema work and implementation guidance
- On-page optimization workflows
- Analytics synthesis and action planning
- Process documentation and project execution

Main development gaps:
- Off-page/link-building deliverables are largely absent
- Brand vs non-brand keyword segmentation is not explicit in core research outputs
- You show **overthinking/over-iteration tendencies** in version-heavy keyword/content files

---

## 1) Keyword Research
**Rating: Skilled (with Overused tendency)**

### Rationale
- Strong: you differentiate intent/funnel and map keywords to URLs with actions.
- Strong: you combine sources (SEMrush/GSC/expansion logic) and maintain QA files.
- Gap: no explicit branded vs non-branded field in major keyword artifacts.
- Overused tendency: multiple "final/updated/copy/qa/v2" variants suggest analysis churn.

### Evidence
- `Omnipress_Keyword_Research_Comprehensive.csv`
  - Columns include `Intent`, `Funnel Stage`, `Search Volume`, `Keyword Difficulty`, `SERP Features`, `Current Position`, `GSC Impressions`, `GSC Clicks`.
- `Omnipress_Keyword_Mapping_FINAL.csv`
  - Includes `Keyword`, `Search Intent`, `Current URL`, `Match Type`, `Suggested Action`, `Notes`.
- `Omnipress_None_Primary_Keyword_Recommendations.csv`
  - Resolves unmapped/none terms into actionable recommendations.
- `Omnipress_None_Remap_QA.csv`
  - QA checks for schema consistency and placeholder removal.

### Overthinking / Misapplication check
- Not a fundamentals failure, but you are close to "kitchen-sink" risk:
  - Large datasets + many versions can slow implementation speed.

## 2) Technical SEO
**Rating: Skilled**

### Rationale
- Strong: advanced structured data work for LegalService pages with implementation-ready JSON-LD.
- Strong: canonical tracking and crawl/sitemap artifacts exist.
- Strong: includes QA controls.
- Gap: less explicit evidence of robots/noindex strategy and CWV execution prioritization framework in final action docs.

### Evidence
- `TDE_Law_LegalService_Schema_Audit.csv`
- `LawLancaster_LegalService_Schema_Audit_2026-02-13.csv`
- `schemas/GTM_Schema_Implementation_Reference.csv`
- `SalesX_Canonical_Implementation_Tracker.csv`
- `Omnipress _ Keyword Research 2.2026 - crawl_depth_l5.csv`
- `Omnipress _ Keyword Research 2.2026 - page-sitemap.csv`

---

## 3) On-Page SEO
**Rating: Skilled**

### Rationale
- Strong: title/meta/H1 optimization workflows are clear and repeatable.
- Strong: internal linking work is structured and trackable with insertion status.
- Strong: page copy deliverables are aligned to search intent and conversion use-cases.
- Gap: ensure final QA standards for AI-assisted body edits are standardized before publish.

### Evidence
- `metadata-h1.csv`
- `ideal-meta-titles-h1s.csv`
- `new-meta-title.csv`
- `new-meta-desc.csv`
- `internal-linking-body.internal-links.csv`
- `TDE_Family_Law_Paid_LP_revised_copy_applied_logic.md`

---

## 4) Content Strategy & Optimization
**Rating: Skilled**

### Rationale
- Strong: documented content maps/gap analysis and coverage status (Mapped/Partial/Gap).
- Strong: strategic outputs connect structure, URL targets, and seed keywords.
- Strong: repeatable SOP and analyzer setup guides indicate scalable process thinking.
- Gap: less explicit persona/journey segmentation in final client-ready strategy docs.

### Evidence
- `TDE_Law_Content_Gap_Analysis.csv`
- `TDE_Law_Content_Gap_Summary.md`
- `Fundamentals Audit _ TDE Law - Sheet1.csv`
- `SOP - Content Audit (1).md`
- `Content_Gap_Analyzer_Setup_Guide.md`

---

## 5) Off-Page SEO & Link Building
**Rating: Unskilled (insufficient demonstrated output in this workspace)**

### Rationale
- I did not find substantive deliverables showing backlink audits, outreach plans, anchor mix frameworks, or digital PR execution/reporting.
- Canonical/duplication work is useful but is not a substitute for off-page authority strategy.

### Evidence (what exists but is adjacent)
- `SalesXceleration_Duplication_Audit_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `salesx_near_duplicates_report.csv`
- `salesx_semantically_similar_report.csv`

---

## 6) Analytics & Reporting
**Rating: Skilled**

### Rationale
- Strong: multi-window comparison (L3M/MoM/YoY), segmented by buckets (service/location/supporting).
- Strong: not just data dumps; reports include drivers, rationale, and action plans.
- Strong: QA artifacts identify data/type conflicts and remediation suggestions.
- Gap: expand explicit ROI tie to revenue pipeline impact and forecast layer.

### Evidence
- `bankfivenine-benchmark-analysis.csv`
- `output/spreadsheet/seo-benchmark/20260216-035530/benchmark-analysis.csv`
- `output/spreadsheet/seo-benchmark/20260216-035530/benchmark-qa.csv`
- `analytics_all.csv`
- `Monthly_Report_2025-12-01_2025-12-31.pdf`

---

## 7) Local SEO & Google Maps
**Rating: Skilled (emerging)**

### Rationale
- Strong: concrete GBP service area and service-description recommendations with local context.
- Strong: location-focused schema and local service pages are integrated into strategy work.
- Gap: limited direct evidence of review-response systems, duplicate GBP resolution workflows, and SoLV/AGR reporting outputs.

### Evidence
- `gbp-service-areas.csv`
- `gbp-service-recommendations.csv`
- `The Aurit Center for Divorce Mediation _ GBP Optimizations _ Glendale _ August 2025 - GBP Service Area - Recommendations.csv`
- `WIP _ GBP - Services Descriptions & Categories.md`
- `LawLancaster_LegalService_Schema_Audit_2026-02-13.csv`

---

## 8) SEO Strategy & Project Management
**Rating: Skilled (with mild Overused tendency)**

### Rationale
- Strong: extensive SOP/workflow/checklist/implementation guidance artifacts.
- Strong: deliverables show clear handoff readiness and QA discipline.
- Strong: mapping + benchmark + action planning shows prioritization thinking.
- Overused tendency: version proliferation and copy/revised/final chains can add cycle time without equivalent business impact.

### Evidence
- `SalesXceleration_Duplication_Audit_Workflow.md`
- `SalesXceleration_Duplication_Audit_FINAL_REPORT.md`
- `AI_Studio_Quick_Start_Walkthrough.md`
- `TDE_Divi_Implementation_Guide.md`
- `Family_Law_Paid_Lander_Checklist.md`
- `Omnipress_Keyword_Mapping_FINAL_QA.csv`

## Direct Answer: Are You Overthinking or Misapplying?

### You are already performing well when:
- Translating large keyword data into mapped actions.
- Producing implementation-ready technical SEO (schema/canonical/local).
- Turning benchmark data into prioritized action plans.

### You are likely overthinking when:
- You create too many near-duplicate "final/updated/copy" versions before execution.
- QA iterations continue after key decision thresholds are already met.

### Possible misapplication risks to correct now:
1. Keyword research: missing explicit branded vs non-branded split in core files.
2. Off-page: no clear authority acquisition pipeline (audits/outreach/reporting).
3. Project flow: some deliverables prioritize artifact refinement over deployment velocity.

## Highest-Impact Skill Development Priorities (Next 30 Days)
1. Add a mandatory `Brand vs Non-Brand` and `Business Value Tier` layer to keyword master sheets.
2. Build one off-page pilot package per client: target list, outreach template, anchor plan, monthly result tracker.
3. Set versioning governance: one working file + one final file per deliverable; avoid multiple final variants.
4. Add forecast section in analytics reports: expected impact by action (traffic/leads assumptions).
