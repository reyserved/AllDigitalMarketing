## 8. Frequently Asked Questions (Objection Handling)

**Q: Do I really need a lawyer for an uncontested divorce?**
A: Yes. Even if you agree, a single mistake in paperwork can cost thousands later. We ensure your agreement is watertight and actually enforceable.

**Q: How is child custody determined in Georgia?**
A: Courts look at the "best interests of the child." This is subjective. You need an attorney who can effectively present your role and history to ensure your parental rights are respected.

**Q: Can you help with emergency situations?**
A: If a child is in danger, we can file for emergency orders immediately. (Note: If you are in immediate physical danger, please call 911 first).
