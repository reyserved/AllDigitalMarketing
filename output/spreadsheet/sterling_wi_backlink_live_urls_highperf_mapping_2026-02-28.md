# Sterling WI — Live-backlink URLs added to High Performers — Mapping + Metrics

- Mapping CSV: `output/spreadsheet/sterling_wi_backlink_live_urls_highperf_mapping_2026-02-28.csv`

## How to read this file
- `Input URL (Ahrefs Target)` is the URL receiving the backlink in the Ahrefs export.
- `Effective URL (Source Used)` is the URL we used as the source page in the WI internal-linking deliverable (based on the mapping method in `tmp/spreadsheets/sterling_wi_backlink_candidate_input_urls.csv`).
- GA4/GSC fields are filled only when the URL is present in the provided exports; missing values mean “not present in export”, not necessarily zero.
- `Core Hub Target (Suggested)` and `Suggested Anchor Text (Assigned)` are pulled from the final high-performer implementation output.
