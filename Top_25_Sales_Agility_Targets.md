## Decision Logic Guide

**1. The "Above the Fold" Rule**
*   **IF** Clarity Scroll Depth @ 25% is **< 55%** (most users leave early):
    *   👉 **Action**: Place banner in the **Hero Section** or immediately after the first H2.
*   **IF** Clarity Scroll Depth @ 50% is **> 60%** (users are reading deeply):
    *   👉 **Action**: Place banner **Mid-Page** (e.g., after the "Services" list) contextually.

**2. The "Hot Zone" Rule**
*   Check the **Click Heatmap**.
*   **IF** there is a cluster of clicks (red zone) on a text block, consider making that text a hyperlink to the assessment using the "Contextual Anchor Text" approach.
