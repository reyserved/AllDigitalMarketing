     A well-designed sales compensation plan motivates superior sales rep performance and maximizes revenue. It empowers your reps to thrive when your company thrives, but also holds them accountable when personal objectives and measures of success fall short. As important as it is, mistakes in how to develop a sales compensation plan are common. 
The Ideal Sales Compensation Plan
The ideal sales compensation plan motivates your reps to make the most money – for themselves and your company. It is clear and concise. Easily communicated. Easily understood. Easily embraced and put into action.
Sounds simple, right? But too often, things get complicated and critical errors are made. What kinds of sales compensation plan mistakes do companies and their sales organizations make? Here are the top (or maybe they’re the bottom) five mistakes that undercut sales rep motivation, sales team morale, and bottom-line revenue performance:
Sales Compensation Plan Mistake #1: Not Having a Clear Link Between Individual and Company Performance 
It is essential for any employee to understand their importance in achieving company goals. This is especially true for sales reps. That’s why, in companies that succeed year after year, sales compensation plans are written so the organization’s success and the individual rep’s success go hand in hand. If the rep performs well, your company benefits; if your company reaches its revenue goals, the rep benefits, too. However, if there is not a clear and easily understood alignment between individual and overall sales results, motivation and performance can suffer. 
Sales Compensation Plan Mistake #2: Lacking Balance Between Salary and Variable Sales Compensation
In most industries, a mix of base salary and variable (i.e., commission, incentive, or at-risk) compensation makes sense. Typically, a 50-50 salary-to-variable sales compensation pay mix ratio is a good place to start. Of course, in such a “leveraged plan,” the actual percentages of each type may vary, but few sales organizations use a salary-only or commission-only structure, as these are usually counterproductive. 
Salary
As a rule-of-thumb, keep a sales rep’s base salary high enough to meet basic needs and financial obligations, but low enough so corresponding commissions and incentives encourage the rep to reach higher. Ideally, the base salary should range between 40 and 60 percent of anticipated total compensation. This is a sliding scale because as the sales rep makes more incented sales, the ratio of salary to total sales compensation decreases.
Commission
Opting for commission-only (or “straight commission”) sales compensation might seem tempting, but it can be de-motivating, especially for newer sales reps or those considering joining your sales team.
When using commissions as part of your sales comp plan, base them on sales or gross profit, but avoid basing them on sales whenever the rep controls any aspect of pricing. Why? Basing commissions on flexible pricing invites price reductions to make the sale.
It may occasionally be appropriate to pay commissions before the rep earns them, especially early in a rep’s tenure when pipelines are being established. So, a commission could be in the form of a draw. However, consider making the draw “recoverable” if commissions aren’t “earned” within a specified period. 
Bonuses and Other Incentives
Bonuses and other incentives can motivate the sales rep to aim higher still. Bonuses are typically paid after the reporting period for meeting or exceeding sales goals. Other incentives may include non-monetary compensation such as trips or gifts. These are often associated with sales contests but are usually best to bolster short-term results. 
Remember this: Unless you strike an appropriate balance between salary and variable pay, your organization will struggle to keep sales reps motivated and performing at top levels.
Sales Compensation Plan Mistake #3: Poor Plan Design and Communication
Even the most well-conceived and financially attractive sales compensation plan can fail to incent and produce results if poorly designed and communicated. Simplicity and clarity are key. Make the plan relatable. Make it clear how the rep fits into the bigger picture and can benefit by individual performance and contribution to the company’s success. 
Keep in mind that sales compensation plan communication shouldn’t just take place once the plan is designed. Communicate with sales reps beforehand to understand their challenges and ideas. If you know what matters to them and their families, you’ll be able to adapt your plan to enhance motivation. When complete, communicate your plan team-wide and with each individual rep. Answer questions and make adjustments as necessary – to the plan, to your communication process, or both.
Sales Compensation Plan Mistake #4: Not Updating Your Sales Compensation Plan Frequently Enough (or Adjusting it During Unplanned Circumstances)
Many companies craft a sales compensation plan that works well and then leave that plan in place year after year. Why mess with success, right? Wrong! Your industry, your marketplace, the employment pool, and the economy are ever-changing. So, your compensation plan should probably change, too. 
Even if changes are minimal, every plan can benefit from annual updates, either to the plan specifics or how those specifics are communicated. Simply put, leaving an outdated sales compensation plan in place year after year puts you at a competitive disadvantage. Unfortunately, according to a recent Sales Xceleration survey, only 30% of companies follow this best practice. 
It’s also important to update your sales compensation plan when unforeseen situations arise that impact your sales rep’s ability to achieve original quotas and goals. For example, if economic factors or crisis conditions significantly change the marketplace or competitive landscape, be prepared to modify your plan as necessary. Your sales compensation plan should reward sales reps for performing at a high level, but never penalize them for falling short due to circumstances beyond their control.
Sales Compensation Plan Mistake #5: Not Gaining Support and Buy-In for Your Plan
By communicating before and during the plan development phase, you send the message that the rep’s challenges are recognized and their insights and ideas matter. Listening and incorporating their feedback into the plan will go a long way toward gaining their support. Once the plan is designed and communicated, be sure to have the rep sign to acknowledge their understanding of plan specifics. This will help eliminate or settle disputes later.

     Quality sales compensation plans incentivize and drive the behavior of your sales team resulting in revenue generation for your company. While it seems obvious that the compensation plan should motivate your sales team to make the most money for both themselves and the company, frequently the plan gets overcomplicated and doesn’t accomplish what was intended.
Avoid these common errors that can reduce a salesperson’s motivation, sales team performance, and ultimately, your bottom line.
Lack of Alignment Between Individual, Team, and Company Goals
After the company goals are created, take time to align them with the sales team and individual rep goals. If a primary company goal is to increase new business, then the team and individual goals should reward the activities that lead to new clients (inside reps) and adding new clients (outside reps) to a higher degree than the activities (inside sales) that would generate additional business (outside sales) from current clients. Goals should be structured so that if the team and individual benefit, so does your organization and vice versa.
Inadequate Balance Between Base and Variable Compensation
Consider the role and market to ensure your offering a competitive on-target earnings (OTE) package that balances pay and bonuses accordingly. When a new sales rep joins your company, account for the time it takes to complete onboarding as well as the length of the typical sales cycle in your industry as part of the compensation plan. How quickly do you anticipate they will begin earning commission?  Are you offering a base salary that attracts new talent while still encouraging and motivating them to reach their sales goals? Offer a base salary with a variable comp and have the percentage split be motivating.
Sub-par Plan Design & Communication
Keep it simple and clear when you design the compensation plan, so it is easy to understand and communicate to your sales team. Discuss the plan with the sales reps and see if they have any concerns or ideas about the plan. You can adjust the plan more effectively to benefit both parties when you know what is most important to them. Once finalized, take the time to communicate to the team as a whole as well as the individual salespeople.
Failure to Adjust or Update Compensation Plans
Don’t create a good plan and think that you can reuse it time and time again. It needs to be reviewed and updated each year. It is important to be nimble and stay up to date with your industry, market, and employees. In a fast-paced business environment, be willing to adapt accordingly to maximize your competitive advantage. Additionally, if an unexpected situation beyond their control occurs that directly impact your sales team’s ability to reach their goals, you must adjust your plan as needed to continue to drive desired behaviors.
Insufficient Input and Support for the Plan
Encouraging sales reps to give input and feedback on their compensation plans as you are designing the plan and incorporating those elements into the plan helps with buy-in. The final step is having them sign and date their compensation plans as an acknowledgement of their agreement and understanding. This simple step reduces disputes that can arise when variable payments are made.
An ideal sales compensation plan looks different across businesses because there are many variables to consider. If you’d like help designing the perfect compensation plan, contact us today to connect with a Sales Leadership Consultant in your area.

     It seems like a crazy notion: Fire your top sales performer? Really?! Why on Earth would you cut loose the one person who brings the most revenue to help your company survive? But the fact is that your strongest salesperson might also be your organization’s weakest link. Here’s how that can happen and what you can do about it:
A Problem Child and Prima Donna
What does the salesperson in question look like? Well, a lot like a “problem child” who’s also a prima donna. Consider the characteristics:
Rule Breaker
The problem child salesperson doesn’t like to follow the rules. In fact, he may not like the fact that rules exist at all. Certainly, they don’t apply to him (he thinks). And aren’t your sales processes rules? Don’t you have procedures in place so each sales effort is manageable and trackable and repeatable? And what about your CRM? If your top salesperson is also a rule breaker, will he – does he? – use your CRM so you can use data to improve your sales operation?
Lone Wolf
The problem child salesperson also probably doesn’t play nice with others. He’s not a team player. He looks out only for his own interests and looks for ways to boost his own sales, even at the expense of  the team achieving its overall sales goals. In this way, the problem child salesperson can willfully upset the team dynamic. And why not? He isn’t concerned with the team; he will just go on his singular way, leaving the other salespeople to gnash their teeth in unison.
Egotist
What’s worse than a salesperson who is also a “problem child”? One who has a sense of entitlement and has become a prima donna. You know the type – that salesperson who has a supercharged ego and an inflated view of his own talent or importance to the organization. Again, he thinks that rules are for everyone else and that he is invulnerable to discipline or termination; after all, he’s your superstar, right? But remember this: If you don’t confront the situation and deal with the prima donna, you are condoning his behavior. What kind of message does that send to your team?
Accountability for All
Tolerating the bad behaviors of a salesperson – even your top salesperson – tells your sales team that numbers matter more than teamwork, and that isolated individualism is valued more than cooperative growth as a cohesive unit. In the short run, this tolerance might yield improved sales, but the discord will impact your organization and could eventually destroy the team.
Think about a different message you can send the team. What if you put in place policies and processes and expectations that applied to every salesperson? In that case, you have a foundation for cooperation and growth. You also have a baseline for discipline and termination should you need it. (With your prima donna salesperson, you will almost surely need it.)
When you think about it, the troublesome salesperson does control his own destiny. He can become a team player and work for the good of the team and the organization, or he can be subjected to discipline. Once the disciplinary process comes into play, the prima donna can cooperate, toe the line and learn from the experience, or he can play his games elsewhere. In any event, you will have sent the right message to your team and even to potential recruits down the line.
By showing your team that you won’t tolerate selfishness, you will encourage teamwork. You will also encourage better communication. Perhaps best of all, you will nurture an environment of positivity and productivity. Imagine the productive time your team will regain if no longer engaged in that ongoing toxic discord. That energy can certainly be better spent if, as a team, you can better define what success looks like, and adapt your processes to achieve that more frequently.
You Are Not Alone
In a recent Aberdeen Group research study of more than 240 sales organizations, findings indicated that 36% of “best-in-class” companies are much more likely (60% vs. 44%) to terminate a top performer due to non-sales issues. Perhaps even more telling is the finding that 54% (vs. a 29% industry average) of these best-in-class companies base at least part of the salesperson’s financial compensation on behavioral components.
Writing about the findings of this study, Aberdeen Group’s Peter Ostrow notes that “hubris-filled ‘A players’ can be destructive to the overall mood, and success, of the team as a whole… with top sellers strutting around like peacocks.” Ostrow refers to these salespersons as “high performing sales jerks,” and notes that their high-maintenance ways command “inordinate amounts of damage control” while tending to “de-credentialize the entire sales function.”
The mere fact that a study like this was necessary shows that this is an industry-wide problem. It also shows that best-in-class sales organizations, on average, recognize the dangers of the prima donna and do something about the situation.
Bottom Line:
Sales management and sales leadership can be complex. Investing in sales leadership training helps managers navigate these difficult interpersonal dynamics effectively. At Sales Xceleration, we know that personalities and performance go hand-in-hand. We also know that inconsistent treatment of sales personnel by management, including tolerance of non-conformance at the expense of teamwork, can poison the departmental dynamic you otherwise work so hard to nurture.
Our Sales Xceleration Licensed Advisors know that sales processes must be well-planned, well-understood and consistently implemented in order for the playing field to be level enough to judge real sales performance. If your sales processes aren’t, or if you find yourself dealing with a prima donna performer who is poisoning your sales team, reach out to an Advisor today, or give us a call at 844.874.7253.

Five Sales Compensation Plan Mistakes that Damage Morale and Ruin Revenue

How Onboarding Can Help Salespeople Get and Stay on Track for Sales Success


    
    ",https://salesxceleration.com/how-firing-your-top-salesperson-might-fire-up-overall-sales-performance/,How Firing Your Top Salesperson Might Fire Up Overall Sales Performance? | Sales Xceleration Blog,"It might seem like a classic case of “biting the hand that feeds you,” but believe it or not, your best move – for the good of your sales team and your entire company.",How Firing Your Top Salesperson Might Fire Up Overall Sales Performance?,"
    
     It might seem like a classic case of “biting the hand that feeds you,” but believe it or not, your best move – for the good of your sales team and your entire organization – might be to fire your top sales rep. What? Cut loose the one person who brings your company the most revenue? That’s crazy! And yet, if your strongest salesperson is also your team’s weakest link, it might be your best, or even your only, logical move.
Here’s why:
There’s No “I” in Team
Every dysfunctional team has at least one “problem child” – someone who defies the team culture and holds tight to their “me first” attitude. Sometimes, this is the same person who closes the most deals and brings in the top sales revenue quarter after quarter. But is that person also sowing such discord that the rest of your team suffers? Do they incite an “us versus them” mindset that keeps your sales team from reaching its potential? It’s certainly possible, and taking a hard course of corrective action is not as uncommon as you might think.
In fact, a recent Aberdeen Group research study of more than 240 sales organizations revealed that “best-in-class” companies are 36% more likely (60% vs. 44%) than other organizations to terminate a top performer due to non-sales issues. What’s more, 54% (vs. a 29% industry average) of these companies base part of the salesperson’s financial compensation on behavioral components.
Recognizing a Disruptive Influence
The “problem child” salesperson is typically a rule breaker: someone who thinks rules exist only to keep others in line. But your sales processes are a set of rules. Aren’t your procedures necessary to make sales manageable and trackable and repeatable? And what about your CRM? Your rule breaker may defy loading data into your tracking system to improve your sales operation. What kind of example does that set for others?
Your disruptive sales leader might also be a lone wolf. This is someone who doesn’t play nice with others. One who looks out only for their own interests and looks for ways to boost their sales, even at the expense of achieving overall team sales goals.
Worse yet, this person also is most likely an egotist – a prima donna with a sense of entitlement. Someone with a supercharged ego and an inflated view of their own importance who believes they don’t have to be part of a team as long as they lead the team in sales.
Tolerating the bad behaviors of a rule-breaking, lone wolf, egotistical salesperson – even your top salesperson – tells your sales team that short-term individual results matter more than long-term cohesion and big-picture team performance.
Cutting the Cord and Finding High-Quality Sales Candidates
So, what can you do if you find your sales team’s culture has become intolerably dysfunctional due to a disruptive top performing salesperson? If you’ve tried corrective action and decided that behavioral issues cannot be tolerated even if sales results are good, it’s probably time to cut the cord and terminate your top salesperson.
The good news is that you might not have to take as much of a “hit” to your sales results as you think. This is for two reasons: first, your other sales team members will probably perform better once the disruptive outlier is gone; second, you can likely recruit a top sales performer quickly and easily by using a dedicated sales talent acquisition resource.
At Sales Xceleration, for example, we place sales candidates that deliver revenue results. Guaranteed.
Your team works with your Outsourced VP of Sales to help you determine what type of sales performer will benefit your organization. Breakaway makes finding high-quality sales candidates easier by utilizing an in-depth process guided by a dedicated talent manager. That manager works with your organization and your Outsourced VP of Sales to profile the ideal candidate profile to provide the right fit for your team.
Your dedicated team will then spend up to 2 hours with each candidate conducting a customized behavioral assessment to reveal both their behavioral profile and sales skillset, including simulation evaluations of key components of the position. In other words, we can identify behavioral red flags (the rule breaker, lone wolf or egoist, for example) before they impact your sales team culture.
Sales Xceleration provides three qualified candidates per position and does so within a few weeks of receiving the request. And we don’t confine our search to candidates who are actively pursuing open positions; rather, we also seek out top sales talent that are currently employed. By going deeper than traditional sales recruiting, we factor in experience, qualifications, team chemistry and many other critical components – all while taking the burden of recruiting off you and your team.
So, what was that guarantee all about? We guarantee you will make a hire and if, for any reason, that hire is not still with your organization, the candidate is replaced for free.
So, don’t tolerate a bad influence on your sales organization just because you fear the short-term impact of your top performer’s lost sales. Take the longer view and recruit another top salesperson who is also a team player.

     Sales Recruiting vs. Sales Hiring: Growing Your Sales Team in 2022
A pandemic, a lockdown, a recession, and more than a few supply chain issues are just some of the hurdles that companies will need to overcome to restore their sales growth in the year ahead. Sounds like an insurmountable task, to say the least, but one that can often be accomplished by rethinking and reengineering the sales infrastructure — the foundation for building a scalable and repeatable sales model.
Prior to the current environment, companies were too busy running their businesses to really delve deep into their operations. They weren’t necessarily looking at the needed elements to build their sales capability. After months of instability, however, all that’s changed. They’re now evaluating whether sales engagement strategies will work in a post-pandemic world. They’re watching how customers or clients have moved to a hybrid sales model — that, or entirely “virtual” for all sales interactions. They’re even evaluating how the overall sales process has changed. Honestly, the list goes on and on.
More importantly, many businesses are now wondering whether they have the right salespeople in the right sales positions. We can certainly attest to that. Many of the businesses coming to us these days want our team to verify whether their current salespeople have the skills to both do the job and support future sales growth.
Companies are in the midst of retooling and reassessing their sales infrastructure to do that and also position themselves to attract great sales talent to build their sales capability. The problem with this is that the talent shortage is real. For companies looking to add to their sales teams, this poses a unique challenge. Finding qualified talent was already a struggle prior to the pandemic, the recession, and so on. People just aren’t as comfortable entering into what many believe to be a challenging role.
Higher education hasn’t helped matters. Most colleges and universities don’t offer courses on “selling.” It’s often chalked up to a trait that someone is born with, and post-secondary education is there to support the chosen industry. However, people can learn to be salespeople, which makes hiring and recruiting key to building a salesforce for the future.
Though interconnected, hiring for sales and recruiting for sales are two different functions, both of which have varying degrees of success. It all comes down to the approach. Companies need to understand what they’re looking for in an ideal candidate. From skills and background to traits and education, great salespeople can be found in myriad specialties and industries when taught and provided with the proper tools and structure.
Sales Hiring Explained
By and large, hiring is the as-needed process of finding and evaluating candidates to fill vacant roles. Many organizations fall short when hiring for sales because they are losing more salespeople than they can bring in to replace their losses. It’s a reactive approach to talent acquisition, with few (if any) success metrics attached to the process. New additions to the team may interview well but might not necessarily be a match for the organization.
If a company ends up with a bad hire, that can cost at least 30% of the employee’s first-year earnings. Beyond the financial impact, bad hiring decisions can also take a toll on company morale, erode employee engagement, tarnish the brand reputation, fracture the sales pipeline, and even damage organizational culture.
At Sales Xceleration, we define hiring a bit differently. The term refers to all the tools needed to employ a solid, capable hiring strategy, and it involves many moving parts:

Job description
Job descriptions should do more than communicate the details of the job (e.g., duties, responsibilities, skills, qualifications, and so on). It should spark interest in job seekers. Focus on the talent you want, and then craft the description to that individual to help readers envision themselves in the role. Use clear, concise language, making sure to avoid any confusion or inconsistencies.
Sales skill set summary
A skill set summary is just as it sounds: a list of competencies, knowledge, experience, and both hard and soft skills that are needed to be a success in the sales role.
Ideal candidate profile
An ideal candidate profile is similar to the skill set summary in that it details the required skills, competencies, knowledge, and experience required for the sales position. This document, however, goes deeper into the personal qualities, past achievements, and other characteristics of the ideal recruit.
Interview strategies
Effective interview strategies go beyond a series of stock questions and should entail follow-up inquiries to an applicant’s responses. They should also involve behavioral interviewing techniques. Asking for specific examples of skill, ability, or knowledge usage can provide insights into not only how the candidate would respond to certain situations, but also their personality.
Beyond sitting down to talk with candidates, other beneficial components to the interview and screening process include employment tests and assessment tools. In fact, a study out of Michigan State’s business school found that both tactics were more accurate indicators of success than interviews alone.
Onboarding plan

Probably one of the most essential components to the sales hiring process, an onboarding plan spells out exactly how to introduce a new hire into the organization. It describes the prior-to-start activities, orientation, materials, training schedule, first-day priorities, first-week priorities, and a number of other elements. By systemizing the process, employers ensure nothing is ever missed and that new salespeople can get up and running as soon as possible.
 Outreach channel selection
Online job ads can certainly work for many positions. Hiring for sales talent isn’t often one of them. Not that employers should avoid posting an open position on job boards, but you’re often better served by using a multitiered approach: networking, targeted ads, employee referrals, recruiters, and even talking to the salespeople who call on the company that you respect. You should also consider looking outside your particular industry for talent with transferable skills.
Job offer
Much like any of the other components of the sales hiring process, extending a job offer often works best when employers establish a system. Having a hiring system in place can improve the chances that a candidate will accept the offer and prepare your team for the inevitable negotiation process. Consider extending the offer personally; detail the salary, benefits, perks, and expectations in writing; and include examples of the bonus and compensation structure.
Hiring for sales is more than a simple process. It’s a critical element that requires attention to detail and more than a little diligence to find the perfect fit. Because it’s a process in which success metrics aren’t established, it’s easy to end up with team members who aren’t a match but simply “interviewed well.” Leave nothing to chance by preparing each and every component before even soliciting and evaluating candidates for an open role.
Sales Recruiting Explained
By definition, sales recruiting involves continuous research and sourcing activities to establish a talent pipeline. Should an opening suddenly come about, companies need only go to their backlog of potential candidates to fill the role. Theoretically, the recruiting process will bring the most qualified of candidates to your operations.
At Sales Xceleration, our definition isn’t much different than that.
Recruiting is the process of searching, screening, and identifying great sales talent that closely matches client needs and sales role profiles. Sales Xceleration prefers to be involved in the sales recruiting process from the very start as the hiring manager on engagement so we can:

Conduct exploratory sessions to fully understand the company, its culture, the industry, and talent needs.
Assign a dedicated talent manager to the account who will serve as the point person and guide the employer through all phases of the recruiting process.
Create ideal candidate profiles that are customized to the organization based on the preferred skill sets, background, attributes, personal qualities, past achievements, and other traits essential to success.
Develop a customized talent acquisition strategy to locate not just ideal candidates but those perfectly suited to the organization as a whole.
Build a custom, sustainable road map for the entire sales recruiting process to ensure the talent pool never diminishes too low.
Offer insights into how the employer can improve the scope, stature, and territory of the sales position to make openings more attractive to top talent.
Source a roster of passive job seekers and all elite talent not often found on job boards.
Engage in active discussions with talent to provide details on the opportunity and “sell” them on pursuing new positions at the employer.
Employ behavioral interviewing techniques, assessment tools, and mindset evaluations to gauge all candidates’ fitness for the role.
Offer our suggestions for the top five candidates, finalize the choice, and then allow the employer to extend the job offer to the new recruit.

For Sales Xceleration, our Amplify Recruiting process offers the focus necessary to source and secure great sales talent based on defined success tactics.
Where to Focus Your Attention: Sales Hiring or Sales Recruiting?
With hiring focused on immediate needs and recruiting focused on future needs, onboarding someone now means hiring should be the focal point. If you are sourcing for the future, turn your attention to sales recruiting.
That said, Sales Xceleration embraces both approaches. For us, hiring for sales is the “macro” term. Sales recruiting is the “micro” term. Prior to launching Amplify Recruiting, we worked with outside recruiting firms. Yet today, our advisors use Breakaway to find great salespeople who are a solid fit. We believe recruiting is really a supplement of the overall sales hiring process. Hiring is the major deliverable we provide to customers, whereas the recruiting process is a sub-element of the hiring module.
Our value is that we own and drive both.
This is critical for our clients, as many of our customers come to us due to previously not hiring the right person in the right role. Early in our client engagement, we assess each sales contributor. In many cases, we need to replace some of the current sales staff with talent that’s a great match in skills, background, and personal attributes.

Don’t Just Hire Great Salespeople – Keep Them!

Dos and Don’ts for Making the Right Sales Job Offer to the Right Candidate

How Onboarding Can Help Salespeople Get and Stay on Track for Sales Success

     Salespeople are the lifeblood of any business that wants to grow and continue to thrive. They are responsible for generating leads, nurturing prospects through the pipeline, closing deals, and boosting the company’s bottom line. However, recruiting talent and hiring top sales reps can be challenging in today’s ultra-competitive job market.
Although hiring top sales talent can be challenging and time-consuming, especially as you look forward to a new sales year, it is possible to employ a successful hiring strategy utilizing some of the best recruitment strategies:
How to Recruit Top Sales Talent
Before you can hire sales talent, you must cast your net in the right sales talent waters. This requires understanding how to recruit employees who can elevate the performance of your sales team.
1. Define Your Ideal Candidate
Identifying the traits and requirements of your ideal candidate can put you on the right hiring path. For example, how much sales experience is required? Are there unique skills needed to represent specific products or service lines or territories? What kind of personality and work ethic would enhance your company and department cultures? Utilize the job description to guide other key questions to be answered.
2. Source Candidates Via Multiple Platforms And Channels
Today, recruiting talent demands using a successful sales hiring strategy that leverages multiple platforms and channels, including job boards, employee referrals, and networking events. Reach out to qualified candidates where you are likely to attract their interest. In particular, use social media to connect with potential candidates. Share content they’ll find relevant and run targeted ads there.
PRO TIP: Don’t be afraid to look outside of your industry. Essential sales skills can often transcend industries, so look beyond the normal talent pool.
3. Screen Candidates Carefully
Once you have a pool of candidates, screen them carefully to identify those most qualified. Review their credentials, conduct preliminary phone or online video screening interviews, and give pre-employment assessments. Once you’ve identified top candidates, conduct in-depth interviews to assess their skills, experience, and motivation. Ask critical questions to help you understand the candidates’ selling style, closing skills, and ability to manage objections. Always use your Ideal Candidate profile to screen and qualify your candidates. It’s important to remember that having a great personality doesn’t necessarily indicate that one has the required skills for a specific job position.
4. Make a Competitive Offer to the Best Candidate
Once you’ve identified the best candidate, propose competitive sales compensation and benefits. Consider adding incentives such as commissions and bonuses to create a win-win outcome. Not sure what the most competitive compensation mix is? Use our compensation guides to view trends, industry benchmarks, and typical salary mix information.
PRO TIP: Top sales talent will always be in high demand, so act quickly, or you could lose them to a competitor. Hear Amplify Recruiting’s VP of Client Delivery share the importance of making a timely job offer.

5. Consider Using a Recruiting Agency
If you’re having trouble finding acceptable candidates, consider using a recruiting agency in your sales hiring strategy. A reputable recruiting agency will have methods, systems, and resources available to bring forth a network of qualified candidates, ultimately making it possible to save time and money.
6. Onboard the New Hire
Once the candidate has accepted your offer, dedicate the effort necessary to properly onboard them. This includes providing the training and resources they need to succeed in the new role. Onboarding must also include integrating them into your department, the sales team, and your overall company culture. Use our onboarding guides to give you a head start on crafting your perfect onboarding plan.
The Bottom Line:
Hiring top sales talent is essential for any business, and the time is always right to optimize your opportunities. But if you are not fully equipped to undertake recruiting talent and hiring salespeople on your own, contact Amplify Recruiting, Sales Xceleration’s exclusive sales recruiting company.

Build a disciplined hiring process to drive performance, cultural fit, and revenue growth.",High-Level Strategies for Identifying and Attracting Top-Tier Sales Professionals,"
    
     Attracting and retaining top sales talent remains one of the most common challenges companies face. The pattern is consistent. The organization wants high-performing sellers, yet the hiring process is not built to target, evaluate, and retain elite-level professionals. The result is predictable: mis-hires, underperformance, and high turnover.
By applying a disciplined and repeatable framework, companies can consistently attract candidates who not only deliver results but also strengthen the culture. The following strategies represent the backbone of that process.


Start With a Strong Position Description and Ideal Candidate Profile
A high-quality hiring process begins with clarity. A well-written position description and ideal candidate profile act as the roadmap your recruiters and hiring leaders will follow. Make the description too narrow and the candidate pool collapses. Make it too broad and you invite mismatches.
Pro Tips

Look for broad-based skill sets relevant to your sales cycle.
Avoid limiting the search to industry-specific candidates. Great salespeople learn fast.
Distinguish must-have attributes from nice-to-have preferences.

This early precision sets the tone for disciplined, effective recruiting.


Incorporate Behavioral Assessments to Identify Top Performers
The highest-performing sales professionals share consistent behavioral traits. While experience matters, mindset and behavior determine longevity and quota-crushing performance. Include a behavioral assessment early in the process to separate average sellers from true A-players.
Elite salespeople tend to possess the following four characteristics:


High Intrinsic Drive
This is the strongest predictor of long-term success. You should prefer the individual you occasionally need to rein in over the one who needs daily motivation.

Professional Curiosity
They ask deeper questions, uncover true needs, and position themselves as trusted advisors. Curiosity fuels better discovery and stronger close rates.

Structured Discipline
Top performers embrace process. They maintain CRM accuracy, protect pipeline integrity, and respect the sales motion because these behaviors drive repeatability.

Coachability
They seek feedback, pursue mastery, and adapt quickly as markets shift. This mindset keeps them at the top of their game.



Define Your Culture Before You Hire
Cultural fit is the force multiplier. A candidate may be talented, but if their natural operating style conflicts with your culture, performance will lag and tenure will be short.
Clarify the cultural traits that drive success for your sales organization:

Do you value collaboration or competition?
Are your top performers data-driven or instinct-driven?
Do you operate in rapid cycles or careful planning?
Is your pace scrappy, structured, or both?

Hiring for sales success requires aligning character and workstyle to your environment, not just evaluating competency.


Build a Recruiting Process That Attracts High Performers
High-caliber candidates evaluate your hiring process with intention. Slow, disorganized, or unclear steps will push them away. A refined process signals that your company is a home for professionals who hold themselves to high standards.
Key elements of a high-performer-friendly process

Lead with value and purpose. Define impact early.
Move fast. Momentum communicates respect.
Use real-world simulations such as discovery calls or pipeline reviews.
Sell the opportunity as much as you assess the candidate.

Top performers want growth, mentorship, autonomy, and upside. Make these visible.


The Bottom Line
Recruiting sales professionals who consistently exceed quotas requires a strategic, intentional process built around behavioral insight, cultural clarity, and well-defined candidate experience. Companies that do this well build high-performing sales teams that deliver predictable, sustainable revenue growth.
If your organization struggles with mis-hires, turnover, or inconsistent sales performance, we can help you build a repeatable, disciplined system that consistently attracts and retains world-class sales talent.

Compensation plans play a key role in a team’s motivation and performance.",Study Reveals Alarming Sales Compensation Plan Trends,"
    
     Your company’s sales compensation plan has a big impact on your team’s motivation, performance and results. No surprise there. What might be surprising, however, is that many companies sabotage sales success with weak, poorly understood, or mismanaged sales compensation plans. Recent results from an ongoing study confirm that such plans are the unfortunate norm; and they leave a trail of missed opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Let’s see what the study revealed, and how you can use these findings to drive better sales performance with an effective sales compensation plan.
About the Study
The statistically significant results are from Sales Xceleration’s Sales Agility Assessment® 4.0. The SAA 4.0 tool analyzes sales management practices and sales performance behaviors at SMBs across the U.S. The results noted below have been compiled from hundreds of responses, primarily from business owners, CEOs and sales team leaders, including VPs of Sales and Sales Managers.
Alarming Sales Compensation Plan Trend #1: Misalignment of Goals and Behaviors
As we noted in this article, a well-designed sales compensation plan incents or rewards sales activity that supports company goals as well as individual ones. Unfortunately, according to the study, this is rare. In fact, it happens in less than one in three U.S. SMBs.
Addressing the question, “Are your organization’s compensation plan(s) bringing the desired results/behavior you seek?”, only 30% of respondents answered, “Yes, the sales team is focusing their time … consistent with Management’s objectives”.
Slightly more than half answered with “the sales team focuses some of their time … consistent with Management’s objectives, but not fully”; while 16% admit that, “No, the sales team seems to focus on products/customers/verticals that are different than what Management would like”.
Frankly, anything less than a full-on “yes” should be unacceptable in any sales organization. In 70% of cases a poorly designed and/or poorly understood sales compensation plan is likely to blame. Perhaps more worrisome is the likely gap in communication and understanding between sales team leadership and their salespeople. If the sales compensation plan is poorly designed or communicated, sales team members will naturally default to what is easily achieved and most beneficial for their own interests.
Best Practice Takeaway: Make sure sales performance goals are clearly communicated, understood, and have commitment from both management and sales team members.
Alarming Sales Compensation Plan Trend #2: Plans Remain Unchanged
Perhaps one reason Sales Rep activities don’t align with company priorities is because plans too often lie dormant. According to the study, nearly two in three respondents report changing their sales compensation plans less than once per year. Two in three! Not changing your compensation plan annually sends the message that you want exactly the same revenue each year, by sales rep, by product, etc. – how can that be the case when your business needs change frequently?
Six percent of respondents change their plans more than once per year. Depending on your industry and sales conditions, this could be acceptable. However, changing a plan too often could be as detrimental as not changing it often enough. Changes implemented too frequently can keep salespeople off balance and confused about expectations.
Three in ten SAA respondents reported changing their plans at the beginning of each year. For most companies, this frequency is optimal, if management wisely evaluates and updates plan components.
Best Practice Takeaway: Update your sales compensation plan annually. Make minor adjustments if necessary between primary update cycles but reinforce key goals with salespeople throughout the year.
Alarming Sales Compensation Plan Trend #3: Pay Mix Between Base and Variable Pay is Not Appropriate
Simply put, straight commission sales compensation is a terrible idea. While straight commission plans may seem low-risk and high-reward for the business owner, they seldom work. They can cause higher turnover, reputational risk, and other long-term problems. Nonetheless, 15% of respondents utilize such a plan.
On the flip side, nearly 1 in 5 companies use a base salary-only plan. While this could be appropriate if sales team members act as “order takers” and do not need to demonstrate true sales skills, this approach is not appropriate for sales organizations. (Order takers really aren’t sales professionals, are they?)
Remaining responses broke fairly evenly between high base salary, low commission (25%), low base salary, high commission (21%), and finally, a structure that pays half base salary and half commission. Twenty percent of respondents use this formula. I think this 50/50 approach is the best starting point for most sales organizations. Deviations could depend on economic conditions, industry standards, and territory and market norms, among other factors.
Best Practice Takeaway: Don’t use a straight commission plan. Do start with a 50/50 plan and adjust as appropriate for your market.
Alarming Sales Compensation Plan Trend #4: Salespeople Aren’t Asked to Demonstrate Upfront “Buy-in” to the Plan
Perhaps the most surprising (and unforgivable) result was that less than half of respondents require their salespeople to sign the sales compensation plan. Worse yet, 40% admit their sales compensation plan isn’t even in written form!
Less than one in three companies said they provide a copy of the written plan, but do not require a signature.
If your sales team members don’t sign a written copy of the plan, they are not truly committing to achieving its goals, let alone to a full understanding of the plan. What’s more, the absence of a signed plan puts the company in a poor position if corrective action, discipline or termination for poor performance become necessary.
Best Practice Takeaway: Require each salesperson to sign a written sales compensation plan to indicate their understanding and commitment. Always!
The Bottom Line:
Sales compensation plans are powerful tools when management and sales team members understand and act on them with unity and commitment. Unfortunately, our SAA 4.0 results reveal that SMBs aren’t using sales compensation plans effectively or to competitive advantage.

     Quality sales compensation plans incentivize and drive the behavior of your sales team resulting in revenue generation for your company. While it seems obvious that the compensation plan should motivate your sales team to make the most money for both themselves and the company, frequently the plan gets overcomplicated and doesn’t accomplish what was intended.
Avoid these common errors that can reduce a salesperson’s motivation, sales team performance, and ultimately, your bottom line.
Lack of Alignment Between Individual, Team, and Company Goals
After the company goals are created, take time to align them with the sales team and individual rep goals. If a primary company goal is to increase new business, then the team and individual goals should reward the activities that lead to new clients (inside reps) and adding new clients (outside reps) to a higher degree than the activities (inside sales) that would generate additional business (outside sales) from current clients. Goals should be structured so that if the team and individual benefit, so does your organization and vice versa.
Inadequate Balance Between Base and Variable Compensation
Consider the role and market to ensure your offering a competitive on-target earnings (OTE) package that balances pay and bonuses accordingly. When a new sales rep joins your company, account for the time it takes to complete onboarding as well as the length of the typical sales cycle in your industry as part of the compensation plan. How quickly do you anticipate they will begin earning commission?  Are you offering a base salary that attracts new talent while still encouraging and motivating them to reach their sales goals? Offer a base salary with a variable comp and have the percentage split be motivating.
Sub-par Plan Design & Communication
Keep it simple and clear when you design the compensation plan, so it is easy to understand and communicate to your sales team. Discuss the plan with the sales reps and see if they have any concerns or ideas about the plan. You can adjust the plan more effectively to benefit both parties when you know what is most important to them. Once finalized, take the time to communicate to the team as a whole as well as the individual salespeople.
Failure to Adjust or Update Compensation Plans
Don’t create a good plan and think that you can reuse it time and time again. It needs to be reviewed and updated each year. It is important to be nimble and stay up to date with your industry, market, and employees. In a fast-paced business environment, be willing to adapt accordingly to maximize your competitive advantage. Additionally, if an unexpected situation beyond their control occurs that directly impact your sales team’s ability to reach their goals, you must adjust your plan as needed to continue to drive desired behaviors.
Insufficient Input and Support for the Plan
Encouraging sales reps to give input and feedback on their compensation plans as you are designing the plan and incorporating those elements into the plan helps with buy-in. The final step is having them sign and date their compensation plans as an acknowledgement of their agreement and understanding. This simple step reduces disputes that can arise when variable payments are made.
An ideal sales compensation plan looks different across businesses because there are many variables to consider. If you’d like help designing the perfect compensation plan, contact us today to connect with a Sales Leadership Consultant in your area.

     As this year ends, one theme has consistently surfaced across industries and boardrooms alike: economic uncertainty has reshaped how organizations think about hiring, but it has not diminished the importance of investing in sales talent.
While many budgets tightened, sales hiring remained mission critical. Companies that continued to hire strategically gained momentum, while those that paused often found themselves playing catch-up as market conditions evolved.
The Shift Toward Strategic Sales Team Assessment
One of the most notable recruiting trends was a renewed emphasis on evaluating existing talent before adding headcount. A shifting economy exposed performance gaps quicker, pushing leaders to move beyond surface-level metrics and take a deeper look at capability, coachability, and long-term fit.
Organizations that invested in thorough sales team assessments were better positioned to identify top performers, uncover development needs, and determine where new hires were truly required. This proactive approach reduced mis-hires and ensured that every addition aligned with revenue goals rather than short-term reactions to pressure.
Hiring Earlier to Stay Ahead of the Market
Another defining trend was the move to hire ahead of traditional timelines. In prior years, many companies waited until Q1 to begin recruiting. Yet we found, those that shifted hiring earlier consistently saw better outcomes.
Top-tier sales professionals spent less time on the open market than ever before. Companies that moved early secured high-impact talent before competition intensified, while those that waited often faced longer searches and fewer qualified options. Early hiring became less about urgency and more about intention and preparedness.
Longer Runways for Onboarding and Ramp Time
Additionally, we saw that even elite performers need time to ramp. Organizations that brought new hires on before year-end gave them space to onboard, learn business, and integrate with their teams ahead of January.
This approach paid dividends. Sales teams entered the new year aligned, trained, and ready to generate pipeline rather than spending the first quarter ramping and resetting expectations. The result was stronger early-year performance and a more predictable revenue trajectory.
What Worked 
What worked best this year was clarity. Companies that aligned hiring decisions to long-term revenue goals, leveraged data and assessments, and treated recruiting as a strategic function consistently outperformed those that relied on reactive or transactional hiring models.
Partnerships also mattered. Organizations increasingly leaned on specialized recruiting partners who understood sales roles, leadership dynamics, and revenue impact rather than generalist approaches that lacked depth.
What Didn’t Work
What fell short was delayed decision-making. Pausing hiring without a clear plan often created downstream challenges, including talent gaps, missed growth targets, and rushed searches later in the year. Shortcuts in evaluation and onboarding also proved costly, reinforcing the importance of process and discipline even in uncertain conditions.
What to Carry Forward Into 2026
As teams look ahead to next year, the lesson is clear. Preparation wins. Intentional hiring, early planning, and a strong understanding of existing team dynamics should remain core priorities. Investing in the right people at the right time continues to be one of the most reliable ways to protect and grow revenue, regardless of market conditions.
At Sales Xceleration Recruiting, a division of Sales Xceleration, specialize in sales recruiting, professional-level searches, and veteran placement initiatives, supported by behavioral interviewing and sales-specific assessments that reveal how candidates think, sell, and stay motivated.
As we move into the new year, the organizations that will outperform are those that prepare early, hire intentionally, and continue to invest in the people who fuel their revenue engine.

7 Ways to Write a Better Sales Job Advertisement


    
    ",https://salesxceleration.com/the-competitive-advantage-of-hiring-sales-talent-in-a-slow-economy/,The Competitive Advantage of Hiring Sales Talent in a Slow Economy | Sales Xceleration Blog,"When the economy slows, smart companies hire sales talent instead of cutting back turning downturns into opportunities for growth and success.",The Competitive Advantage of Hiring Sales Talent in a Slow Economy,"
    
     When the economy slows down, many companies instinctively take a conservative approach—cutting costs, freezing hiring, and riding out the storm. But history shows that the most strategic companies do the opposite, especially when it comes to hiring sales talent. During a recession or economic downturn, hiring salespeople isn’t just a bold move, it’s a smart one.
Great Sales Talent Is More Accessible in a Down Market
Recessions tend to shake the tree. Talented salespeople who were once stable in their roles often become open to new opportunities due to:

Layoffs or downsizing
Leadership changes
Organizational restructures

This creates a rare window for forward-thinking companies to attract top talent that may have been previously out of reach. “A slowdown in hiring across industries opens the door for savvy companies to scoop up top-tier talent that might otherwise be unattainable” (Forbes).
Hire Now, Train While It’s Quiet
Slower seasons give you the luxury of time, something many sales teams don’t have during busy cycles. “In a strong economy, companies often tolerate low productivity levels, but in a downturn, every rep needs to be sharp” says Christopher Lynch, CMO of Mindtickle (Forbes). Build now, so your team is ready to move when the market does. Bringing in new salespeople during a downturn allows for:

Focused onboarding and product training
Sales process development
Relationship-building without pressure for immediate results

Relationships Take Time—Start Building Them Now
Sales is a long game. Deals don’t close overnight, and trust isn’t built in one call. The earlier your team starts engaging with prospects, the more traction they’ll gain over time. “Sales success coming out of a downturn is often tied directly to the seeds planted during the slowdown” (Staffing Industry Analysts). The reps you hire now will be the ones closing deals when others are still trying to get ramped up. Start planting seeds through:

Value-driven outreach
Consistent follow-ups
Insightful, helpful conversations

Position Yourself Ahead of the Recovery Curve
While others wait, you can prepare. Historically, the Federal Reserve has noted that recoveries often bring sharp increases in both demand and hiring. But by the time the recovery is clear, the race for talent is already underway. Hiring now means your team is already trained, aligned, and selling when everyone else is just starting the interview process. According to Indeed.com’s Hiring Lab:

Job postings surge quickly after downturns
Competition for qualified candidates skyrockets

The Bottom Line: Recessions Reward the Bold
There’s no denying that downturns bring uncertainty. But they also reward companies that play offense instead of defense. The best time to hire isn’t when everyone else is doing it, it’s when no one is.

The reps you hire today become your top performers tomorrow
You’ll be positioned to move faster, close earlier, and grow quicker when the economy rebounds
You’ll have the relationships, infrastructure, and momentum that others are scrambling to build

Ready to Outpace the Competition? Let’s Talk.

     One of the keys to running a successful small business is developing a sales compensation plan — specifically one that’s good and fair. Unfortunately, many businesses don’t know how to develop a sales compensation plan.
In this post, we’ll set out to solve that problem. We’ll also delve into critical sales compensation plan details, such as setting goals, measuring performance, finding a balance between pay and incentives, and updating the plan to align with current market conditions.
I. Good and Fair Compensation Plans
Before developing a sales compensation plan, it’s important to understand the components of an effective compensation plan. Certain elements must be included, and certain misunderstandings must be avoided. In this section, we’ll discuss those topics and more.
Defining a Good Sales Compensation Plan
There are two key requirements of a good sales compensation plan: it must motivate salespeople to excel and achieve agreed-upon revenue goals, and it should serve both your sales reps and your company well because each side rises and falls together. Sales reps work to meet specific goals that benefit themselves, but they also help your company grow in the desired manner.
Whatever payment structure you choose, your compensation plan should motivate your sales reps to make the most money they can (for themselves and for your company). To ensure that remains the main objective, keep it clear, direct, and accessible so your teams can easily understand the goal and never stop working toward it.
Misunderstandings About Sales Compensation Plans
One of the biggest misconceptions business owners have about sales compensation plans is that they’re designed to incentivize results rather than behavior. Ultimately, you should want your sales reps to exploit the compensation plan you have in place — yes, really. If their goal is to make as much money as possible, that “exploitation” benefits both them and your organization.
Further, it isn’t just an overall goal that you want to drive your sales team toward. Proper compensation planning needs to incent more heavily where you want that revenue to originate — consider the most profitable products, the most desired industry verticals, and new companies with whom you don’t currently do business.
The misconceptions and misunderstandings don’t stop there, though. Businesses too often think of their sales reps’ compensation as just a paycheck. Sure, employees value pay, but they also respond to variable benefits like retirement, healthcare plans, and bonuses. These compensation options don’t just attract talent — they help companies retain talent.
A clear understanding of these misconceptions is important because letting them linger can lead to mistakes in the way businesses develop or use their compensation plans. Without the right knowledge, you can build a compensation plan that doesn’t encourage the exact behavior you desire, that cannot be fully understood by your sales team, or that won’t attract the sales talent your organization so badly needs.
When businesses don’t understand how to structure a sales compensation plan, they might not find the right balance between base and variable pay. Most companies offer a balanced compensation mix that includes both salary and variable pay, but their compensation plans and overall business will suffer without knowledge of how to do that.
Finally, you risk not making it clear how your sales compensation plans and goals directly connect to and impact your employees. Every sales rep should easily be able to see how their effort helps shape individual and overall company success.
Small Business vs. Big Business Compensation Plans
Companies structure sales compensation plans in different ways depending on their organizational goals, resources, size, and team needs. Some might offer a more substantial salary, while another might make commission the biggest earning opportunity.
Before designing a plan that best fits your company, you should think through a few things. Start by determining your compensation budget, the expectations of your sales team, and what results you seek. While you can look into how others in the industry structure their compensation plans, you shouldn’t just mirror those plans. Just as no two people are exactly alike, no two businesses are either. Effectively designing a compensation plan involves a certain amount of tailoring and personalization to achieve your unique goals.
If you do evaluate other companies’ compensation plans, be mindful of the size of the operation in relation to yours. Large companies are more able to absorb the impact of a plan that doesn’t pan out, but small businesses don’t have the cash flow or margin to make the same mistake. You can get ideas by examining what other big businesses are doing, but compensation plans will never be effective if they’re treated as one-size-fits-all solutions.
Sales Compensation Plans and Success
Small businesses don’t have a lot of room for error, which means it’s vital for them to attract high-performing talent. One way to do that? Build a compensation method with strategic planning at its core.
It’s key for small businesses to keep their compensation structures current and competitive in a changing market. Compensation plans need to change each year. Why? Because your needs and goals change each year. Determine the overall revenue you desire, and decide how much of each product, vertical, or revenue type (new or existing customers) you desire to hit — not only your overall goal but also the mix you prefer. Then, build a compensation plan that encourages your sales team to sell exactly what your company wants.
When recruiting the top sales talent, small businesses benefit from keeping everyone on the same page regarding how compensation will be structured and measured. And when everyone is on the same page, there’s a significantly better chance that business will thrive while employees will stay and grow with the company.
II. Base and Variable Pay
Part of developing a good compensation plan is establishing the right balance of base and variable pay for sales teams. What are the ins and outs of that process? What variables factor into the decision? Where can small businesses go wrong, and how should they determine their ideal mix? The following section will answer these questions and more.
What to Know Before Setting Base Pay
Before taking any action, you should first learn how to set the base pay for your sales reps. It’s key to offer pay that is competitive in the industry and to consider that base salary in relation to total possible earnings. 
If base pay, for instance, is more than half the total expected compensation, your team might not feel as motivated because they will be making the bulk of their money without expending any effort. If it’s well below half, though, you might struggle to attract top-flight talent because they’ll go somewhere they feel offers a more secure pay structure.
Regardless of the specifics of your compensation plan, it needs to drive your sales team forward. Having a strong base pay plan that still properly motivates your team members will allow you to recruit and retain the best talent, and it will also help you identify which salespeople are thriving and which ones have room for improvement.
Variable Pay Options
If you’re working to determine how to incentivize your sales team, there are many forms of variable pay that small businesses can offer to employees. Whether your main offers beyond base pay are commissions, bonuses, SPIFFs, or draws, each comes with its own advantages.
Commissions, for example, give you flexibility because they can either be a flat percentage or gradually increase based on performance. Often, you can pay commissions before sales teams earn them, especially if the employees are getting established; in this case, the commission would take the form of a recoverable draw. Bonuses offer a great way to pay based solely on achievement, which creates relatively little risk for employers. 
SPIFFs can offer a certain amount of money for selling a newly launched product and motivate sales employees to perform well in the short term. Meanwhile, draws let you pay some in advance and tend to be a good fit for businesses with longer sales cycles, seasonable businesses, or those that are just getting started because it evens out future compensation and leaves them with something in the interim.
Striking a Balance Between Base and Variable Pay
As we mentioned in the first section on base and variable pay, one of the biggest mistakes you can make as a small business owner developing a compensation structure is not keeping your base pay close to 50% of expected compensation.
Sales representatives need a base salary that is high enough to meet their basic financial needs but not so high that it keeps them from working toward incentive pay. This means, ideally, base pay should fall between 40% and 60%.
Your sales team might be highly motivated to sell if you offer only a commission, but they will actively look for other roles that provide them with a more secure base salary. If you do make commission your sole variable pay offering, base it on sales or profit but avoid basing it on sales over which reps control the pricing. When offering bonuses or other incentives, you encourage reps to push themselves because their effort leads to rewards.
Determining Base and Variable Pay Policies
There is an old adage about base pay percentage: “I want my reps to eat hamburger, not steak.” This might sound harsh at first, but it ultimately means that you don’t want your reps to “eat steak” just with their base salaries. The steak reward comes when they earn it through variable pay.
Striking a balance between offering too low of a base and too high of a base is tricky. If it’s too low, talent won’t join your team. If it’s too high, your sales reps won’t be pushed to exceed expectations.
Salespeople are wired to succeed by exceeding. They set goals and work to meet and surpass them to improve performance consistently. That said, the most important part of setting target compensation and benefits is finding the balance between base pay and incentives.
III. Setting Compensation Targets
In this section, we’ll dive into setting compensation targets. You need to know what a poorly structured compensation target looks like, how badly structured targets lead to burnout, and how to set the best, most reasonable targets for your own employees.
Off-the-Mark Targets and Their Consequences
When sales compensation targets aren’t structured well, it hurts you and your employees. If you set them too high, they don’t motivate your reps to work harder. If they’re too low, you end up paying too much money for modest sales achievements — and as a small business, you can’t afford to do that.
In the end, the reason you develop and implement a sales compensation plan at all is to incentivize your sales staff to achieve more. Because of that, the targets you set should be attainable and realistic. If they’re not, your team won’t work hard to meet them because they’ll feel like they can’t achieve them.
Aiming too high and expecting too much aren’t the only hallmarks of poorly structured compensation targets, though. Small businesses that aim for the same targets every year without updating them are also taking the wrong approach. Because there are always changing market conditions, goals, and needs, it’s key to evaluate your targets annually to determine whether they’re working well or need improvement.
If targets are too high or aggressive, they’ll cause even the best and toughest salespeople to feel burned out. It’s normal for employees to experience some workplace anxiety, but feeling it for a prolonged period of time over something they can’t control is not healthy for them or your business. Be mindful of the consequences that come with setting unrealistic compensation targets.
How to Set Reasonable Targets
How do you set reasonable targets? What guidelines do you follow? Start by setting a “stretch goal” — an achievable sales goal based on slight stretch and progression. You can base these goals on either individual sales reps or territories, keeping in mind that it’s harder to sell in certain geographic areas or with some clients.
However, the best practice is to assign a customized goal to everyone rather than a catchall target for the team. A multitude of things can impact performance, including seniority, experience, and the size of a rep’s pipeline.
Think of it this way: If a rep has $3 million of expected revenue in her pipeline for the next year, her goal shouldn’t be the same as a rep whose pipeline has $1 million of expected revenue. The playing field wouldn’t be level. By tailoring the goals to the rep, you’ll see far more success.
IV. Updating Compensation Plans
Now that we’ve discussed the requirements of a good sales compensation plan, determining base and variable pay, and setting compensation targets, we’ll discuss the importance of keeping compensation plans current.
Changing Conditions and Sales Compensation Plans
Changing market conditions can upend your sales compensation plan if you aren’t vigilant and proactive. Too many small businesses develop a sales plan that works and then use it for years to come without updates to meet the needs of an evolving talent pool and economy.
Adjustments to compensation plans don’t always need to be major. Sometimes, changes will be small, and work can continue as normal. But businesses that don’t take the time to revise their plans each year put themselves at a serious competitive disadvantage. This is significant, considering one of our recent surveys showed that only 30% of companies make annual compensation plan updates.
Your sales compensation plan needs to stay current to not only match market conditions but also to help you attract top talent. Having great salespeople to drive growth is crucial for small businesses, so it’s necessary to offer compensation that aligns with the talent market.
Mistakes When Updating Compensation Plans
When updating your sales compensation plans, be mindful to make changes based on how easy or difficult it is for your sales reps to achieve their goals. Changing market conditions aren’t the only reason to stay current.
If you find that some sales reps can’t achieve original quotas — or that they easily surpass them — it’s important to be ready to adjust. Your sales compensation plan is meant to serve as a reward system for employees rather than a punishment for falling short.
When you consider just how many factors — economic, personal, financial, and more — can impact sales, you see just how necessary it is to adapt and evolve as needed.
How to Update When Market Conditions Demand It
If you don’t change your plan to reflect market conditions and the new goals you desire, you can make it too easy or too difficult for sales reps to achieve their goals — while the organization hasn’t satisfied theirs.
If there is too much of a chance (or not enough) that your reps will hit their goals, there isn’t much incentive to try. The problem doesn’t stop there. Turnover increases when salespeople aren’t being challenged or are being challenged too much; they want to work for an organization that takes care of them. Be creative to ensure you’re working toward this win-win conclusion.
Compensation plans should be dynamic. To align with your revenue goals, build a plan that moves sales reps to action and motivates them to succeed. How can you do this? Start by looking at salary surveys that examine sales employees’ base and variable pay as well as the total target compensation versus actual compensation — both metrics that measure sales performance.
Beyond this, look at occupational and salary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or from Glassdoor or Payscale for base pay and variable ratios. Market data allows you to strategically establish targeted sales compensation plans for every role.
In the end, learning how to develop a sales compensation plan requires you to also learn the requirements of a good compensation plan, the compensation budgeting process, how to incentivize your sales team, and the importance of keeping your plan updated.
It’s clear that having a strong sales compensation plan is one of the primary keys to running a successful small business. We created a sales compensation checklist to help you do exactly that: Download it here to start developing your compensation plan and watch how it strengthens your business.

    ",https://salesxceleration.com/compensation-plan-errors-to-avoid/,Compensation Plan Errors to Avoid | Sales Xceleration Blog,"Sales Xceleration helps you design simple, motivating sales compensation plans that align goals, boost performance, and drive predictable revenue growth.",Compensation Plan Errors to Avoid,"
    
     Quality sales compensation plans incentivize and drive the behavior of your sales team resulting in revenue generation for your company. While it seems obvious that the compensation plan should motivate your sales team to make the most money for both themselves and the company, frequently the plan gets overcomplicated and doesn’t accomplish what was intended.
Avoid these common errors that can reduce a salesperson’s motivation, sales team performance, and ultimately, your bottom line.
Lack of Alignment Between Individual, Team, and Company Goals
After the company goals are created, take time to align them with the sales team and individual rep goals. If a primary company goal is to increase new business, then the team and individual goals should reward the activities that lead to new clients (inside reps) and adding new clients (outside reps) to a higher degree than the activities (inside sales) that would generate additional business (outside sales) from current clients. Goals should be structured so that if the team and individual benefit, so does your organization and vice versa.
Inadequate Balance Between Base and Variable Compensation
Consider the role and market to ensure your offering a competitive on-target earnings (OTE) package that balances pay and bonuses accordingly. When a new sales rep joins your company, account for the time it takes to complete onboarding as well as the length of the typical sales cycle in your industry as part of the compensation plan. How quickly do you anticipate they will begin earning commission?  Are you offering a base salary that attracts new talent while still encouraging and motivating them to reach their sales goals? Offer a base salary with a variable comp and have the percentage split be motivating.
Sub-par Plan Design & Communication
Keep it simple and clear when you design the compensation plan, so it is easy to understand and communicate to your sales team. Discuss the plan with the sales reps and see if they have any concerns or ideas about the plan. You can adjust the plan more effectively to benefit both parties when you know what is most important to them. Once finalized, take the time to communicate to the team as a whole as well as the individual salespeople.
Failure to Adjust or Update Compensation Plans
Don’t create a good plan and think that you can reuse it time and time again. It needs to be reviewed and updated each year. It is important to be nimble and stay up to date with your industry, market, and employees. In a fast-paced business environment, be willing to adapt accordingly to maximize your competitive advantage. Additionally, if an unexpected situation beyond their control occurs that directly impact your sales team’s ability to reach their goals, you must adjust your plan as needed to continue to drive desired behaviors.
Insufficient Input and Support for the Plan
Encouraging sales reps to give input and feedback on their compensation plans as you are designing the plan and incorporating those elements into the plan helps with buy-in. The final step is having them sign and date their compensation plans as an acknowledgement of their agreement and understanding. This simple step reduces disputes that can arise when variable payments are made.
An ideal sales compensation plan looks different across businesses because there are many variables to consider. If you’d like help designing the perfect compensation plan, contact us today to connect with a Sales Leadership Consultant in your area.

     Although most people know that hiring strategies have a major impact on their business goals and the success of their team culture, many companies phone in their hiring processes. They wait until they need to fill a crucial position rather than beginning the process early. This is known as reactive hiring.
Often, those who practice reactive hiring simply don’t consider what hiring strategies will be best for their recruitment needs now and in the future. They have their mindsets stuck on solving problems rather than proactively growing teams.
The risks of this approach are magnified right now because of the lingering effects of the pandemic, with fewer people in the market, fewer people going into sales, new working styles, and a lack of sales infrastructure. Leaders have been too busy trying to survive and pivot into the immediate future to spend good time on reengineering operations. But now, the need to evaluate the sales model and renovate how hiring works is urgent. Sales leaders can no longer afford to cut corners when trying to build successful sales teams.
Why doesn’t a reactive hiring strategy work?
The problem with a reactive hiring approach is that it runs the risk of poor time management, lower talent level, and poor company fit.
For example, waiting until a position opens means that you’ve only got a narrow selection of candidates to choose from — candidates who happen to be available and seeking jobs. The odds are you won’t zero in on that special person who will adopt your values and perform well for your company.
In fact, more than just missing out on a great fit, you could speed the hiring process into a bad match, one that risks your existing team dynamic. A narrower hiring window often ends up elongating the hiring process and making it costlier. A slapdash interviewing and onboarding process is also likely to leave candidates with a poor impression of your company ethos and have a negative impact on your reputation as an employer.
Instead, have a dedicated sales infrastructure, include a hiring infrastructure devoted to assessing existing sales capabilities, locate skills and talent gaps, prepare growth opportunities for internal and external talent, and boost employee morale.
Is internal hiring better than external for a proactive hiring strategy?
An internal hiring strategy is a crucial piece of a solid sales infrastructure. Beyond finding the best talent for the role, an internal strategy can also boost your existing team and create an atmosphere of growth and opportunity within your workplace.
Internal hiring has several benefits compared to opening hiring externally. Reduced costs can save funds for onboarding and continued training, which brings new energy and value to your team. The internal hiring process is also shorter, giving you more time to get new hires settled and motivated.
An internal process also creates a more open, less rigid environment within the sales environment. Employees, whether new or senior, will envision their intracompany careers differently if they can see opportunities for promotions and upskilling.
However, there are inevitable disadvantages to internal hiring. For a start, it can’t go on forever — sooner or later, a promoted employee will leave behind an open position, which will then require a whole new hiring process.
There’s also a downside regarding employee morale. If you are proactively recruiting, this should not be a problem. But if internal hiring creates a competitive environment, colleagues can find themselves at odds rather than collaborating peacefully. Sharing with the team why someone got the role and why they were the best candidate is key. And the last thing to watch for is that promoting someone before they are ready could turn into a long-term problem.
But external hiring can also bring in new perspectives, new skills, and a diversity of age ranges and backgrounds while giving the internal team a boost in energy and renewed focus. A mix of internal and external hiring strategies will fuel a company’s sales infrastructure with the kind of talent it needs to grow.
How can hiring fit into a well-functioning sales infrastructure?
To become a useful and sustainable part of your sales infrastructure, hiring should be treated as a core process. Use the metrics and analyses that you would use in other business operations so that hiring is no longer a mysterious art but more of a science, and tactics can repeatably lead to successful hires.
Recruiting in sales should begin with leaders acknowledging who and what they need in their teams. A defined set of skills can then become a job description that tells a story about how the right candidate will fit into the company. The hiring team can then work out an interviewing and onboarding plan, focusing on that specific skill set.
This could mean using behavioral or role-play interviewing techniques. Behavioral interviewing techniques are modes of questioning that investigate a candidate’s experience and ability with certain skills. Instead of getting a surface-level understanding of the candidate’s working life, a behavioral interview will provide details and anecdotal evidence of how the candidate has used particular skills to get results in the past. This gives interviewers a clear picture of how candidates will handle a day on the job and will make it far more likely that the individual hired will go on to be successful.
At Sales Xceleration, we make recruiting a vital, integral piece of the sales puzzle. We keep hiring processes tied to the overall business and sales goals of a company — from job description writing to screening and interviewing sales talent — and this approach ends up finding great talent matches.
What should recruiting in sales actually look like?
Many stages and processes are involved in hiring, so how do you know how each stage should go? How long should it take, and what should it entail?
The short answer is that timelines will vary depending on the role you’re looking to fill. According to research by Glassdoor, hiring processes vary in different states, cities, and industries. If you want the longest hiring process, go to a government department in Washington, D.C. If you want the shortest, try restaurants in Kansas City.
These results should tell you something about the scale of the hiring process you might need. With highly skilled and qualification-heavy roles, like those in the aerospace, energy, and biotech fields, interview processes need to take longer and be more detailed. This is a good rule of thumb to follow if you’re looking for an individual with a particular skill set and you want to really test that they can thrive in your sales environment.
Job title also determines the time and complexity you’ll need in your searching, interviewing, and onboarding processes. The average interview process length for a regional sales manager, for example, is 39.7 days, but a lower-level sales representative will require a shorter turnaround.
Your hiring process will depend on the unique character traits, values, and skills you’re looking for. You need a hiring plan, but you also want to leave the process open to change so you can follow tangents and spend more time exploring the talent that emerges.
What’s more, recruitment doesn’t end after you’ve hired a new salesperson. As you bring that person into the fold of your organization, you must continue to onboard, teach and train, and begin the new process of figuring out how to keep that person happy and successful in their role.
The strongest sales teams never stop searching and always keep a finger on the pulse of the talent pool. At Sales Xceleration, we have a lot of expertise in the complex topic of hiring.

    ",https://salesxceleration.com/sales-hiring-strategy-how-to-hire-top-sales-talent/,Sales Hiring Strategy: How to Hire Top Sales Talent | Sales Xceleration Blog,"Although hiring top sales talent can be challenging, it is possible to have a successful hiring strategy utilizing some of the best recruitment strategies.",Sales Hiring Strategy: How to Hire Top Sales Talent,"
    
     Salespeople are the lifeblood of any business that wants to grow and continue to thrive. They are responsible for generating leads, nurturing prospects through the pipeline, closing deals, and boosting the company’s bottom line. However, recruiting talent and hiring top sales reps can be challenging in today’s ultra-competitive job market.
Although hiring top sales talent can be challenging and time-consuming, especially as you look forward to a new sales year, it is possible to employ a successful hiring strategy utilizing some of the best recruitment strategies:
How to Recruit Top Sales Talent
Before you can hire sales talent, you must cast your net in the right sales talent waters. This requires understanding how to recruit employees who can elevate the performance of your sales team.
1. Define Your Ideal Candidate
Identifying the traits and requirements of your ideal candidate can put you on the right hiring path. For example, how much sales experience is required? Are there unique skills needed to represent specific products or service lines or territories? What kind of personality and work ethic would enhance your company and department cultures? Utilize the job description to guide other key questions to be answered.
2. Source Candidates Via Multiple Platforms And Channels
Today, recruiting talent demands using a successful sales hiring strategy that leverages multiple platforms and channels, including job boards, employee referrals, and networking events. Reach out to qualified candidates where you are likely to attract their interest. In particular, use social media to connect with potential candidates. Share content they’ll find relevant and run targeted ads there.
PRO TIP: Don’t be afraid to look outside of your industry. Essential sales skills can often transcend industries, so look beyond the normal talent pool.
3. Screen Candidates Carefully
Once you have a pool of candidates, screen them carefully to identify those most qualified. Review their credentials, conduct preliminary phone or online video screening interviews, and give pre-employment assessments. Once you’ve identified top candidates, conduct in-depth interviews to assess their skills, experience, and motivation. Ask critical questions to help you understand the candidates’ selling style, closing skills, and ability to manage objections. Always use your Ideal Candidate profile to screen and qualify your candidates. It’s important to remember that having a great personality doesn’t necessarily indicate that one has the required skills for a specific job position.
4. Make a Competitive Offer to the Best Candidate
Once you’ve identified the best candidate, propose competitive sales compensation and benefits. Consider adding incentives such as commissions and bonuses to create a win-win outcome. Not sure what the most competitive compensation mix is? Use our compensation guides to view trends, industry benchmarks, and typical salary mix information.
PRO TIP: Top sales talent will always be in high demand, so act quickly, or you could lose them to a competitor. Hear Amplify Recruiting’s VP of Client Delivery share the importance of making a timely job offer.

5. Consider Using a Recruiting Agency
If you’re having trouble finding acceptable candidates, consider using a recruiting agency in your sales hiring strategy. A reputable recruiting agency will have methods, systems, and resources available to bring forth a network of qualified candidates, ultimately making it possible to save time and money.
6. Onboard the New Hire
Once the candidate has accepted your offer, dedicate the effort necessary to properly onboard them. This includes providing the training and resources they need to succeed in the new role. Onboarding must also include integrating them into your department, the sales team, and your overall company culture. Use our onboarding guides to give you a head start on crafting your perfect onboarding plan.
The Bottom Line:
Hiring top sales talent is essential for any business, and the time is always right to optimize your opportunities. But if you are not fully equipped to undertake recruiting talent and hiring salespeople on your own, contact Amplify Recruiting, Sales Xceleration’s exclusive sales recruiting company.
