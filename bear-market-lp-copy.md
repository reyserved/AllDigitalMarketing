## Why This Guide Matters

Why.H2: Why Planning Beats Predicting

Why.Body1: During volatility, investors can feel compelled to act quickly. The risk is turning temporary stress into a permanent decision.

Why.Body2: Use this guide to keep decisions aligned with your plan—not to forecast markets.

Why.BalancedReminder: Markets and economies are uncertain. Declines can deepen or last longer than expected. Losses are possible, and no strategy guarantees a positive outcome.

Framework.Lead: Use this sequence to keep decisions grounded in your plan.

Framework.Card3.Title: Step 3: Coordinate Taxes and Cash Flow
