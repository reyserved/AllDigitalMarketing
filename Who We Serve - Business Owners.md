# Wealth Management for Business Owners

Running a successful company takes daily focus, but your personal wealth requires the same level of intention. Based in Naples, Florida, Moran Wealth Management provides fiduciary, client-first guidance to help business owners align company value with long-term personal goals.

## A Coordinated Strategy for Business and Personal Wealth
Your business is often your largest asset. We take a coordinated view of your balance sheet, cash flow, and long-term objectives so decisions about growth, compensation, and reinvestment stay aligned with your personal plan. This integrated approach helps you pursue opportunity while preserving flexibility and control.

## Pre-Liquidity Planning and Exit Readiness
Liquidity events can reshape everything, from tax exposure to family legacy. We help you plan before a transaction so you can evaluate options with clarity and confidence.

- Exit readiness and timeline planning
- Coordination with your CPA, attorney, and deal team
- Evaluation of deal structure and after-tax outcomes
- Post-transaction income and portfolio strategy

## Tax Strategy and Retirement Plan Design
Tax decisions influence both enterprise value and family outcomes. We coordinate proactive tax strategy with retirement planning to help you keep more of what you build.

- Owner and executive compensation planning
- Retirement plan design (401(k), profit sharing, SEP, cash balance plans)
- Tax-aware portfolio construction
- Ongoing review of deductions, timing, and distributions

## Owner Compensation and Equity Planning
Your income often comes from multiple sources: salary, distributions, equity, and future value. We help you evaluate compensation structure and equity concentration so your personal plan stays aligned with how your business creates value.

- Compensation modeling and cash flow alignment
- Equity concentration analysis and staged diversification
- Coordination around vesting, buy-sell agreements, and liquidity timing

## Diversification and Concentrated Risk Management
Business equity can create meaningful opportunity and meaningful risk. We build a diversification strategy that respects ownership realities while helping you reduce concentration over time.

- Structured diversification planning
- Liquidity planning for uneven cash flows
- Asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance
- Risk-aware rebalancing as circumstances change

## In-House Investment Management with Transparency
Our in-house portfolio management team provides access to 35+ proprietary investment strategies and a clear view of holdings and performance. We use Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) to align your portfolio with your objectives and provide transparency at every step.

We establish an investment policy framework that clarifies objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon, then maintain consistent monitoring and rebalancing as markets and goals evolve.

## Business Continuity, Risk, and Protection Planning
Protecting what you have built requires attention to the risks that can disrupt ownership and family stability. We address protection planning as part of a comprehensive wealth strategy.

- Business continuity and succession coordination
- Key person and ownership protection planning
- Liability and insurance review
- Contingency planning for unexpected events

## Family, Legacy, and Philanthropy Planning
Your business can be a foundation for multi-generational success. We help you structure legacy and charitable plans that reflect your values and support long-term stewardship.

- Estate planning coordination and wealth transfer
- Family governance and communication planning
- Charitable giving strategies and donor-advised funds

## Frequently Asked Questions
**What does a fiduciary advisor do for business owners?**
A fiduciary advisor is legally required to act in your best interest. For business owners, that means integrating business value, personal goals, and risk management into a single strategy.

**Do you help with exit and succession planning?**
Yes. We help you prepare for a sale or transition, coordinate with your deal team, and develop a post-transaction plan for income, taxes, and long-term investment strategy.

**Can you work with my CPA and attorney?**
Absolutely. We coordinate with your trusted professionals to ensure that tax, legal, and investment decisions are aligned.

**What retirement plans do you help design?**
We evaluate options such as 401(k) plans, profit sharing, SEP IRA, and cash balance plans, and recommend what best fits your business structure and goals.

**How do you handle concentrated business equity?**
We create a diversification plan that balances liquidity needs, risk tolerance, and long-term objectives, while respecting the realities of your ownership position.

**When should I start planning for a liquidity event?**
Ideally, planning begins well before a transaction so you can optimize structure, tax outcomes, and post-liquidity investment strategy.

**Do you work with owners who are still focused on growth?**
Yes. We support business owners in growth mode by aligning compensation, cash flow, and investment strategy with long-term objectives, even when a liquidity event is not yet on the horizon.
