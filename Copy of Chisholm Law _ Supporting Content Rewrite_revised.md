# **Nonprofit 101: What Is a Nonprofit?** 

Many people feel called to solve a problem in their community, but the legal framework for doing so can be confusing.

## **Definition of nonprofit**

A nonprofit is a legal entity organized and operated for a collective, public, or social benefit, unlike a business which operates to generate profit for its owners. In legal terms, it is a corporation formed under state law that does not issue stock or pay dividends. While it can (and should) generate revenue, all funds must be reinvested into the organization’s mission rather than distributed to individuals.

## **How nonprofits differ from for-profits**

The primary distinction lies in ownership and the distribution of earnings. A for-profit business is owned by shareholders or proprietors who expect a financial return on their investment. A nonprofit has no owners; it is held in the public trust. If a nonprofit dissolves, its assets must be transferred to another eligible nonprofit or government entity, not to the founders.

Another key [**difference between nonprofit & for-profit**](https://chisholmfirm.com/what-is-not-for-profit-and-how-is-it-different-from-nonprofit-2/) entities is tax treatment. Qualified nonprofits can apply for federal and state tax exemptions, meaning they do not pay corporate income tax on revenue related to their mission.

## **Nonprofit vs. Business Diagram**

| Feature | For-Profit Business | Nonprofit Organization |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Goal** | Maximize profit for owners | Serve a public mission |
| **Ownership** | Private individuals/Shareholders | No owners (Public Trust) |
| **Profit Distribution** | Dividends paid to owners | Reinvested in the mission |
| **Tax Status** | Subject to income tax | Eligible for tax exemption |
| **Funding** | Sales, investors, loans | Donations, grants, program revenue |

## **Revenue rules**

A common misconception is that nonprofits cannot make a profit. In reality, a nonprofit is allowed to end the year with a surplus (revenue exceeding expenses). In fact, maintaining a financial reserve is healthy for stability. The rule is not about *making* money, but about *using* it. The “non-distribution constraint” prohibits the payout of profits to insiders (founders, board members, or staff) as personal gain, other than reasonable compensation for services rendered.

## **How nonprofits are structured**

Because there are no owners to make decisions, a nonprofit is governed by a Board of Directors. The Board is legally responsible for overseeing the organization’s activities, finances, and adherence to its mission. Operations are guided by Bylaws, which are the internal rules adopted by the Board. This governance structure ensures accountability to the public and regulatory bodies.

## **IRS categories**

Not all nonprofits are the same. The IRS recognizes over two dozen [**types of nonprofits**](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-types) under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. The most common is 501(c)(3), which includes charities, religious organizations, and educational institutions. These organizations are eligible to receive tax-deductible donations. Other types, such as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations or 501(c)(6) trade associations, are tax-exempt but generally cannot offer tax deductions to their donors.

## **How nonprofits qualify for 501(c)(3)**

To achieve the coveted 501(c)(3) status, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes (such as charitable, religious, educational, or scientific). This involves filing Form 1023 or Form 1023-EZ with the IRS. The application must demonstrate that the organization will not operate for the benefit of private interests and will not intervene in political campaigns.

Learning [**how to start a nonprofit**](https://chisholmfirm.com/6-legal-considerations-for-starting-a-nonprofit-organization/) involves navigating both state incorporation laws and federal IRS regulations to ensure full compliance.

## **FAQs**

**Can nonprofits make profit?**

Yes. Nonprofits can and should generate more revenue than they spend to ensure financial stability. However, any surplus (“profit”) must be reinvested into the organization’s mission and operations, rather than distributed to individuals as dividends.

**How do nonprofits get money?**

Nonprofits utilize diverse revenue streams, including individual donations, government and foundation grants, corporate sponsorships, fundraising events, and income from selling goods or services related to their mission.

**Do nonprofits pay taxes?**

Generally, 501(c)(3) organizations are exempt from federal corporate income tax. However, they may still be liable for payroll taxes for employees, sales tax (depending on state law), and taxes on income unrelated to their charitable purpose (UBTI).

**Who owns a nonprofit?**

No one “owns” a nonprofit in the traditional business sense. It is a non-stock corporation held in the public trust. Control is vested in a Board of Directors who govern the organization on behalf of the community it serves.
