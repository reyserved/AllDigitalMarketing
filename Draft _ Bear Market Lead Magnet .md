**Balanced reminder:** Markets and economies are uncertain. Declines can deepen or last longer than expected. Losses are possible, and no strategy guarantees a positive outcome. Remaining invested does not assure recovery over any particular timeframe. Use this guide to align decisions with your plan, not to forecast markets.

## **Part 1: Why Planning Beats Predicting**

A bear market is commonly described as a decline of 20% or more from a recent high in a broad market index. Labels matter less than the pressure they create. During volatility, investors can feel compelled to act quickly. The risk is turning a temporary stress into a permanent decision.

**Key principle:** You do not need a forecast to be prepared. You need a process that keeps decisions aligned with your goals, time horizon, and liquidity needs.

---

## **Part 2: The Bear Market Discipline Framework (4 Steps)**

### **Step 1: Protect Liquidity**

Bear markets become most damaging when investors must sell long-term assets at depressed prices to fund near-term spending.

**Liquidity Checklist**

☐ List your next 12–24 months of cash needs (spending, taxes, tuition, planned purchases, charitable gifts, property, known obligations).  
☐ Identify reliable cash sources: income, cash reserves, short-term instruments, planned withdrawals.  
☐ Confirm your sleep-well buffer, sized to your plan and obligations.  
☐ Identify discretionary levers you could reduce or delay if needed.  
☐ Know where emergency liquidity could come from without improvising.

**Goal:** Your plan should not require selling long-term assets at depressed prices to meet near-term needs.

**Worksheet: Liquidity Ladder (No Tables Version)**  
Write amounts and sources for each bucket.

| Timeframe | Amount | Source(s) | Account | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0–6 months |  |  |  |  |
| 6–12 months |  |  |  |  |
| 12–24 months |  |  |  |  |

**Caution:** Liquidity sources can carry their own risks (for example, reinvestment risk, credit/interest-rate risk, penalties). Consider your circumstances and consult your advisor.

---

### **Step 2: Reconfirm Risk**

Volatility reveals what you own and how it behaves. It also tests whether your risk level is realistic.

**Risk Alignment Checklist**

☐ Identify **concentration risk** in a single stock, sector, employer equity, or concentrated strategy.  
☐ Understand the primary **drivers of your portfolio** (equities, interest rates, credit, real estate, alternatives).  
☐ Confirm **private and illiquid holdings** are sized appropriately for your liquidity needs.  
☐ **Match time horizons**: fund near-term needs with appropriate assets.  
☐ Ask honestly: “If markets declined further, could I **stick with this plan**?”

**Goal:** Risk should match your goals and capacity, not the emotional intensity of the moment.

---

### **Step 3: Coordinate Taxes and Cash Flow**

Bear markets can create planning opportunities, but actions must be coordinated and individualized.

**Tax & Cash-Flow Checklist**

☐ Review **year-to-date gains and losses**.  
☐ Identify positions with **losses** that may be candidates for tax-loss harvesting (**subject to wash-sale rules** and your tax situation).  
☐ Review **charitable giving plans** and funding approach (for example, appreciated assets, donor-advised funds).  
☐ Confirm **distribution needs** and required withdrawals, if applicable.  
☐ Align investment decisions with **upcoming tax payments** and known cash needs.

**Important:** This is not tax advice. Coordinate decisions with your CPA or tax professional.

---

### **Step 4: Install Behavioral Guardrails**

A written process can prevent reactive changes that are difficult to reverse.

**Behavioral Guardrails Checklist**

☐ Create a cooling-off rule: no major changes without 48–72 hours.  
☐ Require a written reason for any change, tied to goals, liquidity, or risk capacity.  
☐ Define what would justify change (for example, goal or liquidity changes).  
☐ Define what will not justify change (for example, headlines and short-term predictions).  
☐ Reduce noise by limiting portfolio checks to a set cadence.

**Template: Guardrails Agreement**

* I will not make major changes without 48–72 hours and a written rationale.  
* My rationale must tie to goals, liquidity, or risk capacity (not headlines).  
* I will check my portfolio on this cadence: ☐ monthly ☐ quarterly ☐ other \_\_\_\_\_\_  
* I will review any proposed change with my advisor before execution, when feasible.

**Goal:** Your plan should be stronger than your emotions.

---

## **Part 3: The Decision Filter (Use Before Changing Strategy)**

Answer in order:

1. **Did your life change?**  
   Examples: income change, health event, business event, major purchase, new dependents, legal change. If **yes**, a review may be appropriate.

2. **Did your goals or time horizon change?**  
   If **yes**, your plan may need adjustment.

3. **Are you reacting primarily to fear or headlines?**  
   If **yes**, pause and apply guardrails before acting.

4. **Would you still want this new strategy if markets fell another 10–15%?**  
   If not, it may not be a durable strategy for you.

**Rule of thumb:** Changes are most defensible when tied to your plan and circumstances, not the news cycle.

---

## **Part 4: Bear Market Checklists**

### **Before Volatility**

☐ Confirm a 12–24 month liquidity plan.  
☐ Review concentration and diversification.  
☐ Document your risk target and rebalancing approach (bands, frequency).  
☐ Identify no-regret tasks (beneficiaries, insurance review, estate basics).  
☐ Set a communication cadence for reviews.

### **During Volatility**

☐ Revisit liquidity first.  
☐ Avoid major shifts without cooling-off and written rationale.  
☐ Review risk exposure vs. targets instead of improvising.  
☐ Coordinate any tax-related actions with professionals.  
☐ Reduce noise and focus on controllables.

### **After Volatility**

☐ Reassess risk alignment and portfolio drift.  
☐ Update your written plan with lessons learned.  
☐ Rebuild reserves if you used them.  
☐ Reconfirm goals and milestones.  
☐ Schedule a structured, non-emotional review.

## **Part 5: One-Page Bear Market Action Plan (Fillable)**

1. My next 12–24 months cash needs:  
2. My reliable liquidity sources (cash, income, reserves):  
3. My most significant risk exposures (concentration, rates, credit, illiquids):  
4. My guardrails (rules I will follow):  
   * I will not make major changes without 48–72 hours, written rationale, and advisor review.  
   * Portfolio check cadence: ☐ monthly ☐ quarterly ☐ other \_\_\_\_\_\_

5. Questions for my advisor or CPA:

**Advisor Meeting Prep: Document Checklist**

☐ Most recent account statements  
☐ Cash-flow summary for 12–24 months  
☐ Tax documents relevant to realized gains/losses  
☐ Charitable giving plans  
☐ Any life changes since last review

---

## **Part 6: Conversation Guides**

**With Your Advisor**

* How secure is my 12–24 month liquidity under different scenarios?  
* Where is my concentration risk, and what are the options to reduce it over time?  
* What is our rebalancing policy (bands and frequency), and how will we implement it during stress?  
* Which tax-aware moves are worth exploring now (subject to my CPA’s guidance)?  
* Are there behavioral guardrails we should formalize together?

**With Your CPA/Tax Professional**

* What is my year-to-date realized gain/loss picture?  
* Would tax-loss harvesting be beneficial in my situation (consider wash-sale rules)?  
* How should we coordinate charitable gifts this year?  
* Do upcoming tax payments affect portfolio cash needs?

---

## **Part 7: Implementation Aids (Put These in Your Doc/PDF Appendices)**

**A. Rebalancing Policy Template (Illustrative)**

* Target allocation ranges (for example, ±5% bands).  
* Rebalance quarterly or when bands are breached, subject to liquidity, taxes, and transaction costs.  
* Document each rebalance with date, rationale, and trades.  
* Review policy annually.

**B. Communication Cadence Template**

* Portfolio review: ☐ quarterly ☐ semiannual ☐ annual  
* Interim check-ins if life changes or liquidity needs shift.  
* Meeting agenda includes Liquidity Ladder, Risk Snapshot, Tax Coordination Map, and Guardrails.

**C. Personal “If/Then” Rules**

* If headline anxiety rises → then reduce inputs (apps/alerts), review guardrails, and revisit Liquidity Ladder.  
* If portfolio drift exceeds bands → then schedule a policy review before acting.  
* If a life event occurs → then contact advisor within X days.

## **The Role of an Advisor During Volatility**

Advisors do not replace CPAs. They complement them. During periods of market stress, an advisor can:

* Coordinate investment and tax decisions so moves are evaluated after tax.  
* Translate market outcomes into planning adjustments tied to goals and liquidity.  
* Model tradeoffs across competing objectives (risk, return, tax impact, cash flow).  
* Help keep portfolio policy aligned with long-term objectives.

## **Preparing for Your CPA/Advisor Meeting: Questions Worth Asking**

1. Which decisions this year had the largest impact on taxes or risk?  
2. Where were outcomes driven by timing rather than totals?  
3. Which planning opportunities should we evaluate before year-end?  
4. Where do you see gaps between our tax picture and our financial plan?  
5. Do upcoming liquidity events require changes to our allocation or cash set-asides?

## **Documents to Have Ready: Final Readiness Checklist**

☐ Prior-year return and YTD realized gains/losses  
☐ Account statements and portfolio summary  
☐ Trust/entity information and beneficiary designations  
☐ Anticipated income or liquidity events (option exercises, K-1s, sales)  
☐ Charitable giving plans and documentation  
☐ Prepared questions for CPA and advisor
