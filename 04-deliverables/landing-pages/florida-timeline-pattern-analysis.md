## Structural Pattern Observed

1. Two-column row:
   - Left: short process intro (`H2` + supporting paragraph)
   - Right: vertical timeline module with five steps
2. Timeline composition:
   - Single vertical gold line
   - White circular nodes for each step
   - Each step contains: `Step label` + `Step title` + `gold divider` + `description`
3. Section palette:
   - Dark navy section background
   - White process copy
   - Gold accent for line, labels, dividers
4. CTA placement:
   - A centered button follows the timeline block, keeping conversion action directly after process explanation

## Context Fit Rules Applied To New Trademark Mockup

1. Timeline is used only where content is procedural:
   - Added a dedicated `5-Step Trademark Continuity Timeline` section for sequence-based legal workflow.
2. Kept visual grammar consistent with source pattern:
   - Vertical gold line + white nodes + step label/title/divider/text hierarchy.
3. Adapted content context for trademark planning:
   - Steps focus on `asset mapping`, `ownership verification`, `assignment`, `use-control implementation`, and `renewal monitoring`.
4. Preserved page-level architecture balance:
   - Timeline inserted as one specialized section while other sections follow the live fundraising state-page rhythm.
