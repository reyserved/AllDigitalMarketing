## Additional Elements

**Patterns**

**Angles**
Angles are based off the shape of the logo icon and can be used in layouts in various ways. These shapes, besides adding to the branded feel, are used to draw attention, create movement, and help lead a viewer’s eyes around a piece. The below show examples of how to use these shapes.

**Icon Style**
Brand icons:
* are set on 50% brand gray (15% black) circles.
* include simple, geometric illustrations.
* use only white, brick, bright red, and gray.
* include shading (in brand gray) that fades at an angle taken from the X in the logo.

When creating other icons, please be sure to follow this style, and also keep line width consistent with this example.

**Notched boxes**
The notch of the box is on the bottom right of a rectangle or square, and is created using angles from the logo icon. Standard rectangles/squares can be used as well, but the notch can be used for an extra bit of style.

## Photography
Photos should feel natural and positive, and usually will depict sales success.
* While stock photos can be used, be sure not to select photos that feel unnatural. Stick with candid photography or genuine-feeling portraits. Avoid AI-generated images.
* Images depicting sales success will focus on individuals or teams. They feel professional, confident, successful, cheerful.
* Choose photos that include diversity.
* Photos should feel bright and cheerful but naturally lit.
