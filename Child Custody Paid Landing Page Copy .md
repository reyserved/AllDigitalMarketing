## **The Stakes**

When custody is uncertain, everything feels unstable—school routines, holidays, transportation, decision-making, and your ability to show up consistently. You shouldn’t have to “figure it out as you go” while the other side pushes their version of the story.

**We help you get organized, get strategic, and get heard.**

## **Our Approach (Strategic “Fighter” Positioning)**

We push for resolution when it protects you and your child—**but we don’t back down from litigation** when the other side won’t be reasonable. We prepare your custody case as if it could be decided by a judge, so you’re not negotiating from weakness.

**What that means for you:**

* A plan (not guesswork)

* Clear facts and documentation supporting your position

* Readiness whether this settles—or goes to court

---

## **How We Build a Stronger Custody Case**

Custody decisions often hinge on details: routines, reliability, consistency, and what’s workable for the child.

**We help you:**

* Define what you want (and what you’ll accept) in a realistic plan

* Organize the documentation that supports your position

* Avoid mistakes that weaken credibility in negotiation or court

* Communicate strategically so conflict doesn’t become evidence
