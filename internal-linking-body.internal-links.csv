     In March, in Indiana and around the country, college basketball fans go a little mad as the NCAA basketball tournament takes center stage – or should I say center court! As we watch and root for our favorite teams (Go Dawgs!), I’ve been thinking about how this relates to sales organizations, sales departments, and sales teams. There are many parallels between basketball and sales; chief among them is the expectation of championship caliber performance for the good of the team.
So, how is a salesperson like an athlete? How can you determine whether they get to be a starting player or a benchwarmer? And what if they just aren’t making the grade – how can you tell when it’s time to cut them from the team? It might not be as difficult as you think. Read on to learn how to make the right call:
Game Time Performance
Nothing is a better indicator of your salesperson’s effectiveness than results. Forget talk. Forget excuses. Focus instead on results. For a player on the court, there are key performance metrics like points, rebounds, blocked shots, assists, and so on. Same thing for salespeople. Ask yourself: “Are our salespeople:

hitting their sales goals?”
setting up high-percentage shots when prospecting and increasing their sales pipeline?”
asking for assists and seeking one-on-one sales coaching when needed?”
quickly learning from and applying sales coaching in game situations?”
ready to play when the clock starts?”
eager to assist their sales teammates to get that big score?”
making in-game adjustments to be better positioned to win sales?”

If you can answer “yes” to all or most of these questions, you’ve probably got clutch performers who deserve to be on your sales team and in the game dealing with key prospects. If not, you’ve got more analysis and/or coaching ahead, and decisions to make. This is often where business owners seek outside sales management consulting to gain an objective perspective on team performance.
Commitment
Commitment is a baseline for acceptable performance. The more desirable trait in a salesperson is a higher level of commitment; let’s call it passion. The best salespeople are passionate not only about their product or service; they are also passionate about truly providing the best solutions for customers. They have a servant mentality and an inherent curiosity that leads to better decision-making and client service.
The committed, passionate salesperson is eager to improve and always reaching higher to better serve the customer. The committed and passionate sales performer works harder to learn new sales skills or learn more about their prospects. The committed and passionate salesperson also shows up early and works later to get a jump on the competition.
Attitude
The traits above are key indicators of sales performance abilities, but they might mean little if your salespeople have bad attitudes that can easily be detected by prospects, current customers or competitors. On the other hand, if you’ve got top on-court performers with great attitudes, you’ve got real leadership potential on your sales team. To assess key attitude attributes, ask yourself: “Are our salespeople:

quick to shift the blame for failed sales efforts to other team members, to outdated sales collateral or marketplace conditions?”
easily discouraged when the going gets tough?”
complaining early and often?”
acting with an air of entitlement based on past accomplishments or inflated egos?”

If you answered “yes” to even one of the questions above, you probably have some serious motivational and correctional coaching to do. Ultimately, you’ll have to ask yourself if the salesperson with a bad attitude is worth the negative impact on your sales team and on how the market sees your company. You might be able to bench a skilled performer until his or her attitude improves, but not for long.
What are some attributes of salespersons with great attitudes? They are optimistic (but not unrealistically so). They are resilient. They inspire others to give more. They find ways to overcome obstacles. They have a servant mentality. And they simply execute instead of making excuses.
Bottom Line:
Sales and basketball have a lot in common. But sales success demands more than game time performance; it also requires extraordinary commitment and a winning attitude. In larger organizations, sales is also a team sport. Some players deserve playing time, others need to be benched, and still others should be cut from the roster.

/**/Is your sales process effective and efficient? Or is it missing critical factors that could help accelerate your sales growth? If you aren’t sure how to answer these questions, your sales process – and your company’s overall sales performance – could suffer. Here’s a closer look at some commonly overlooked sales process essentials:
Sales Process Definition
In order for your team to make the most impact with their sales efforts, they must first understand the organization’s long-term sales goals – or your Sales Strategy – as well as be provided a clear roadmap that will inform every step they take – a Sales Process. For top sales performance and results, your sales strategy should be…
…a well-defined, goal-focused, clearly communicated, and mission-oriented plan that positions your solutions (i.e., your products and services) uniquely in the minds of your targeted customers while also providing actionable direction for your sales organization.
Naturally, it follows that an effective and efficient sales process is the mechanism by which your sales strategy gets accomplished. In particular, a sales process is…
…the series of steps necessary to complete stages in your sales cycle; that is, ideally, to turn a lead into a prospect and a prospect into a customer.
The best sales process is:

Well-defined and goal-oriented with meaningful benchmarks and milestones
Clearly communicated and understood within your sales organization and can be consistently executed by all members of your frontline sales team
Measurable, with results having a direct correlation to stages in the process so improvements can be made when appropriate
Customer-focused, with the end goal of solving a customer pain point or satisfying a want or need

Improving Your Sales Process
Before you can start streamlining your sales process, it’s important that you establish clear objectives. What do you want to achieve? Are there any specific goals or milestones that need to be met? You should also think about what resources will be needed to reach these objectives. Once you have established these objectives, you can begin creating a plan for achieving them.
Of course, we understand it’s easier said than done, so if you are unsure where to start, we have a few best practices to steer you in the right direction:

Fail fast. See what works and what doesn’t. “Holding on to an unreliable, losing methodology too long keeps you from hitting your goals sooner.”
Document your sales process. Even if you are unsure if the process has all the necessary stages, it’s important to put it on paper so you can improve and build upon what you have. Beyond this, make sure your customer relationship management (CRM) system matches your sales process
Follow your documented process. The only way to know whether your sales process works is by following it consistently. By sticking to your process, you can pick out places to test something different. It’s like performing an A/B split test on a piece of marketing. When everything else is done the same way, making a small tweak in your method half the time will reveal whether the tweak makes it better, worse, or has no effect.
Stay open for best-practice adjustments. If success rates begin to dip over time and you’ve been consistent in following your sales process, it is probably time to make adjustments. The buyer’s journey is a dynamic process, and your selling processes should follow suit.

Now, let’s explore those sales process failures that could be threatening your sales success…
Failure #1: Not Putting Your Sales Pipeline in Perspective
According to our recent research, only 15% of small to mid-size businesses prioritize their customers based on their potential. Before you take bold action to revamp your sales process, it is important to understand the influence of your pipeline and lead nurturing. Simply put, focusing on pursuing new business sales activity while ignoring quality prospects in your current sales pipeline is shortsighted. Ultimately, balance is important and this calls for assessing what is currently in your pipeline, at what stage, and the probability-of-closure timeline.
If your sales pipeline has weak overall conversion potential, your sales team will probably need to ramp up the focus on new sales activity, at least for a while. If your company has a healthy pipeline, however, closing deals within the pipeline should be far easier than starting from scratch and hoping unqualified leads quickly become customers.
Failure #2: Not Using Available Data to Optimize Your Sales Process
Measuring sales performance is key to being empowered to improve your sales management process. To make this easier, use a data-driven sales approach with your CRM system as the central hub. Of course, it is critical to first ensure the quality of your CRM and the data and level of detail within it. Remember that essential data can be influenced by technology, economic and market forces, your product and service mix, and even what your competitors are doing. So, make sure your CRM system is flexible, adaptable, and that you keep it up-to-date, both in its design and configuration and in the currency of data.
Use meaningful data, particularly leading (vs. lagging) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), to provide critical benchmarks and mileposts throughout the sales process. For example, by aligning forward-looking sales performance metrics with important CRM sales process steps, you should be able to more accurately forecast sales. By analyzing how well your process moves prospects toward conversion, you could, for example, forecast a bottleneck where misdirected sales resources could cause an engaged target to drop out of the sales funnel, resulting in a missed opportunity.
In fact, data analysis should be a funnel of its own – one that first provides big-picture snapshots of overall performance, and then enables you to drill down to actionable detail. While the big-picture view can reveal the effectiveness of your overall sales strategy, it’s at the detail level where process refinements can produce significant results.
Analyze the numbers when it makes sense. There’s no need to wait for year-end or quarter-end to run reports. If your data is relevant and aligned with your processes, you should be able to analyze sales data when necessary to identify and fix trouble spots. Don’t micro-manage but make sure your numbers have context, both internal and external. For instance, if your sales outperform your competitors in a tough economic landscape, even weak internal performance data could indicate that your sales processes are working despite market challenges.
Failure #3: Not Using Role Playing to Elevate Individual Performance
The best sales process is only as strong as the delivery of those executing it – the sales reps. And sales reps perform better when supported by training and individualized professional development. This calls for practice.
Hall of Fame NFL coach Vince Lombardi said, “only perfect practice makes perfect.” That’s why well-designed and delivered sales role-play can be critical to informing and improving your sales process. Certainly, sales role-plays can be an effective way for salespeople to hone their presentation skills in a safe sales training environment customized to their needs, your business solutions, and especially, your customers.
How should you use role-plays?

Make role-plays a regular part of your sales meetings, not only when there is a perceived problem
Make your role-play training realistic, but also challenging, including possible tough customer objections and even tense interpersonal exchanges
Always remember that role-plays should not be used to shine a harsh light on a salesperson’s mistakes or weaknesses; instead, it should provide constructive – not destructive – training for enhanced sales performance
Never practice sales techniques on your customers. Make sure you have explored scenarios and solutions beforehand, so your reps don’t falter in front of a key prospect or buyer
Use our role-play feedback tool to help provide constructive notes for your sales team

Failure #4: Not Using a Sales Playbook to Keep Moving Toward the End Zone
As Lombardi and all winning coaches know, your best performance on any field of endeavor depends on the strength of your playbook. Formal or informal, your playbook provides the strategies and processes for leading a prospect through the sales funnel – again, from turning a lead into a prospect and a prospect into a customer.
Your sales playbook should include:

Well-defined sales processes
Available resources and training materials
Any documents needed throughout the buyer’s guided journey (i.e., elevator pitches as well as scripts for handling anticipated sales scenarios and overcoming common objections.)

Used in conjunction with role-playing, the playbook can be a vital tool to optimize sales performance and results. Best of all, with the right pieces in place, you’ll be able to use your sales playbook to both define and refine sales processes based on real-time conditions and results.

Actionable Tips You Can Use Starting NOW
Back to that key question: Is your sales process effective and efficient? If not, here are 7 steps to getting on the right path:

First, determine where you stand in key sales process and performance areas. You can get started by taking the free Sales Agility Assessment. The SAA can provide insights necessary to develop and implement your best sales process improvement plan.
Let go of what’s not working. Try innovative approaches. Fail faster!
Clearly define, document, and communicate your sales strategy and your sales process — the core deliverables of professional sales strategy consulting — making sure there’s an unmistakable link between the two.
Analyze your sales pipeline in relation to where your sales team dedicates their sales efforts.
Upgrade or make better use of your CRM, making sure meaningful and measurable data that should be in the system actually is entered into the system – as part of your sales process.
Perform role-playing as a regular part of sales meetings.
Begin building and maintaining your Sales Playbook.

Key Takeaways
Here are some essential things to remember for correcting these sales process failures:

It’s important to understand the relationship between your Sales Strategy and your Sales Process
An effective and efficient sales process is how your sales strategy gets accomplished. In particular, it empowers you to turn a lead into a prospect and a prospect into a customer.
The best sales process is customer-focused, well-defined, goal-oriented, clearly communicated, and well-understood within your sales organization. It is measurable, too, with metrics that facilitate ongoing process improvement.
When assessing or changing your sales process, it’s important to consider your current sales pipeline and lead nurturing efforts with an eye toward what is currently in your pipeline, at what stage, and the probability-of-closure timeline.
Measuring sales performance via Key Performance Indicators, is key to improving your sales process.
Sales role-plays can empower salespeople to hone their presentation skills in a safe sales training environment; and can be critical to improving your sales process
Along with role-playing, the sales playbook can be vital to optimizing sales performance and results and helping refine sales processes

https://salesxceleration.com/news-events/press-release-inc-magazine-unveils-its-annual-list-of-americas-fastest-growing-private-companies-the-inc-5000/,"
     For the 2nd Time, Sales Xceleration Inc. Appears on the Inc. 5000, Ranking No. 2840 With Three-Year Revenue Growth of 140.49% Percent
NEW YORK, August 14, 2020 – Inc. magazine revealed that Sales Xceleration Inc. is No. 2840 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, and No. 27 in Indiana, No. 208 among honorees in the Business Products and Services field, and No. 20 in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. It is an honor to be a part of this list that represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.

https://salesxceleration.com/why-organizations-need-to-align-sales-and-marketing-processes/,"
     In today’s competitive landscape, organizations can no longer rely solely on their reputation or word-of-mouth referrals to attract and retain customers. Any customer-facing organization seeking to improve sales must align sales strategies with marketing campaigns. This will ensure a cohesive approach that provides a seamless customer journey that fosters long-term relationships and customer satisfaction.
Below are seven reasons why marketing processes are crucial to enhancing sales for organizations to achieve long-term success.
1. Building Brand Awareness
With the rise of digital media and changing customer expectations, effective marketing processes have become essential to support sales best practices. Utilizing a customer relationship management software such as Claritysoft or HubSpot, integrated with a comprehensive multi-channel marketing strategy, enables businesses to streamline operations, enhance customer engagement, and drive sales growth.
In a saturated market, standing out is critical. A well-defined marketing strategy ensures that an organization’s unique value proposition is consistently communicated across various channels to build and maintain brand awareness. This includes:

A professional website,
an active social media presence,
and regular content updates.

By doing so, organizations can establish themselves as thought leaders in their industry, which can attract potential customers and referrals.
2. Targeted Customer Acquisition
Not all customers are the right fit for every organization. Effective marketing strategies allow organizations to identify and target their ideal customer profiles. Through market research and data analysis, organizations can tailor their marketing efforts to reach the specific demographics, industries, or case types they specialize in. This targeted approach increases the efficiency of marketing efforts and improves the quality of customer acquisition, leading to more successful and satisfying customer relationships.
3. Enhanced Customer Relationships
Marketing is not just about acquiring new customers; it’s also about nurturing existing relationships. Regular communication through:

newsletters,
customer appreciation events,
and informative content

can keep an organization top-of-mind with past and current customers.
Organizations can foster loyalty and encourage repeat business by demonstrating ongoing value and expertise. Additionally, satisfied customers are more likely to refer others, creating a positive feedback loop that supports business growth.
4. Digital Presence and SEO
In the digital age, a robust online presence is indispensable. Marketing strategies that include search engine optimization (SEO) and social media can significantly enhance an organization’s visibility on search engines. Potential customers often turn to Google and other search engines when deciding on a product or service.
Organizations can improve their search engine rankings and attract more organic traffic by

Optimizing their website content,
Creating (or maintaining) local listings,
Asking for and monitoring online reviews.

This visibility is crucial for capturing potential customers when actively searching for a solution to their challenge.
5. Measurable Results and Continuous Improvement
One of the advantages of modern marketing strategies is the ability to measure results and adjust accordingly. Tools like Google Analytics, marketing automation systems, and social media insights provide valuable data on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Organizations can (and should) track metrics such as

website traffic,
conversion rates,
and customer engagement

This data-driven approach enables continuous improvement and ensures marketing efforts align with business objectives.
6. Adapting to Market Trends
Regardless of industry, organizations are subject to evolving trends and customer expectations. Marketing processes help organizations stay agile and responsive to these changes. Organizations can adapt their services and marketing strategies to meet emerging demands by monitoring market trends, competitor activities, and customer feedback. This adaptability is key to staying relevant and competitive in a dynamic market.
7. Building a Strong Reputation
Reputation management is a critical aspect of marketing. Marketing strategies that can enhance an organization’s credibility and trustworthiness include

public relations efforts,
customer testimonials,
and case studies

By showcasing their culture, successful outcomes, and satisfied customers, organizations can build a strong, positive reputation that attracts new customers and instills confidence in existing ones.
Conclusion
Marketing efforts to support sales strategies are no longer optional for organizations intent on growth; they are necessary. From building brand awareness and targeting the right customers to enhancing relationships and adapting to market trends, effective marketing processes drive profitable growth and ensure long-term success.
As an Outsourced Sales Leadership solution, Sales Xceleration Advisors can help organizations build the Sales Xceleration Framework™ needed to create and execute a consistent sales strategy. When coupled with well-defined marketing strategies such as Value Proposition development and Multi-Channel Marketing Integration, it provides a strategic approach that will ensure survival and drive thriving success in today’s fiercely competitive landscape.

Putting Sales at the Center of Strategy

Five Things Top Sales Leaders Do Differently

    ",sales leadership training,,insert_contextual_clause,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/why-i-left-a-successful-career-in-sales-leadership/,"
     Anyone who has spent time in sales knows how challenging it can be. Few other careers publicly monitor your progress so closely — your value and worth are only calculated in dollar signs. That sort of scrutiny can wear anybody down, and it’s one of the many reasons why I stepped away from a successful corporate career in the field.
Like most career paths, working in sales leadership includes many pros and cons. Sales leaders aren’t just responsible for their own success; they must also work to ensure the success of their teams. Sales leadership is about supporting, empowering, and encouraging, but it is also about accountability and tough conversations. It is wonderful to help other people achieve their goals, but it can be frustrating when salespeople don’t put forth the effort necessary to be successful — and when their lack of success affects you.
That lifestyle can be extremely draining on a physical, mental, and emotional level. Sales burnout makes it hard to maintain a reasonable work-life balance. Sales is also typically the only role in a company where everyone knows how you are performing at all times. Your goals are public, and your results are public — what other department has that dynamic? Sales VPs are typically only in their roles for 19 months, which can give superiors a sense of “What have you done for me lately?” The pressure takes a toll on you.
Time to Move On
At some point in life, we all undergo a transition when we no longer value the title, responsibility, money, and prestige of our careers — or at least we don’t value it as much as we once did. We realize that no title is worth as much as time with our families and that no amount of accolades is better than a meaningful relationship. Perhaps you have been chasing all the wrong things for so long that it has become difficult to know how to find your true purpose.
I knew it was time to leave my corporate sales leadership role behind when I realized I had lost myself in many ways. Five signs helped me see that it was time to move on:
1. My work-life balance was abysmal.
When I was in the throes of my sales leadership career, I missed important events in my kids’ lives. Heads of sales are expected to be on the road a great deal. Even when I was home, it didn’t feel like my time was actually my time. When I should have been eating dinner with my family, I was on calls supporting my reps and the corporate office. I realized that if I waited too long, I wouldn’t get another chance to watch my children grow up.
2. I felt like I was in meetings 24/7.
I spent my days stuck in back-to-back meetings and was no longer helping my team members become the best they could be. I was spending more time with peers and superiors than with my team (which is what I always loved to do). I didn’t want to have career regrets about spending my days talking to other leaders instead of helping my team in every way possible.
3. The corporate bureaucracy was overwhelming.
Because of all the corporate nonsense that takes place in many organizations, it’s almost impossible for common-sense decisions to be made in sales. People are too often more worried about posturing and agendas than getting the job done. Projects drag on, and inefficiency runs rampant. That was extremely frustrating to me when I wanted to be able to move projects forward.
4. I lost my voice.
As the head of sales, I was arguably more knowledgeable about sales than any other person in the company — but I felt like I wasn’t being heard. I didn’t expect to have my opinions acted on all the time, but I did expect to be listened to and respected. I knew I had a valuable perspective to share, and it was disheartening to feel like I was constantly being dismissed.
5. I felt compelled to give back.
I had acquired a lot of knowledge throughout my career, and I wanted to put it to better use to help others. It was scary and exciting to think about going out and making it on my own, and I didn’t want to let any more time go by without at least trying.
Finding your true purpose in life is easier said than done. But now that I’ve switched over to sales advisory, my life is far more meaningful. I’m helping build and develop companies while empowering the people they work with.
If any part of my story resonated with you, it might be time for you to reevaluate your true purpose and work to avoid rocking chair regrets. How do you evaluate your success? Revisit how you define success and whether the sales burnout you’re experiencing will be worth it in the end. If not, it might be time for a change. It’s a wonderful feeling to know you’re truly doing meaningful work and giving back.

     Sometimes business leaders are at a loss as to why company sales are stagnant or declining.  They look in the mirror and then check-in with their executive team, but no one can offer a clear-cut solution.  The old saying is, “I don’t know what I don’t know.”  What they do know is that they need a sales expert – now, but they cannot afford the price tag that comes along with such an individual to diagnose the problems, fix the issues and lead their sales team effectively.  However, there is a solution – and it’s called an “outsourced,” “part-time,” or “fractional” sales leader.
What is a fractional sales leader?
A fractional sales leader becomes a part-time addition to the C-suite or executive leadership team. The right fractional sales leader has been an executive leader for years, so they’ve walked in your shoes. S/he brings a much needed “outside perspective” to sales strategy consulting and the tools and tactics needed to stimulate sales revenue growth. However, unlike full-time employees, the outsourced sales leader works part-time and often commutes from a different location or state for key meetings and interaction with the sales team. They probably even have an office at your company that they utilize when they’re onsite, although meetings can also occur virtually.
How might your company benefit from partnering with a fractional/outsourced sales leader?
Fractional sales leaders are a great fit for small to mid-sized companies that don’t need or can’t afford a permanent “VP of Sales.” Fractional sales leaders also work well in companies that have existing sales leadership, but want the perspective of an outside expert. In addition to serving as a part-time member of the C-suite, fractional sales leaders usually offer other services to their clients, such as acting as the full-time interim executive during the search for a permanent VP of Sales.  The ability to “rent instead of hire” has the side benefit of saving on costs associated with recruiting, interviewing and relocation.
Why does someone choose to be a fractional sales leader?
Successful fractional sales leaders have an impressive track record of C-Suite success and experience. They have an interest in leveraging their significant experience to help companies, but don’t want to work full-time for one organization or have to relocate from their home location. Fractional sales leaders built robust corporate careers on their passion for having a huge positive impact on the bottom line of their businesses. Highly qualified outsourced sales leaders know how to balance their time across multiple companies, and they enjoy the flexibility that comes from such a schedule.
Imagine if you could pick up the phone and hire a sales leader anytime you need one!
You can! Fractional sales leaders can be there quickly, and they will roll up their sleeves and immerse themselves in your company.  This is exactly what our licensed Advisors across the country do for our clients.  Click here to connect with a Sales Xceleration Advisor in your area, or contact us today at 1.844.874.7253.

https://salesxceleration.com/whats-your-superpower-and-how-are-you-using-it-to-help-others/,"
     Are you a superhero? I realize that none of you are Superman, Batman, or any of the other superheroes, but in your own unique way you have superpowers you take for granted, powers that others admire you for – and need you for. Face it, everyone is good at something. In fact, most people are super at certain things and sometimes a great many things. But what sets superheroes apart from other competent, highly skilled, and accomplished individuals often lies in how they use their superpowers. For example, an otherwise commonplace talent or skill can become an extraordinary power when used for the good of others. This is true in most facets of life, and certainly true in business. And because sales strength lies at the heart of business success, sales leaders just might be unsung superheroes. What superpowers do these sales leadership superstars possess?
At Sales Xceleration, our licensed Advisors are sales leadership consultants who typically serve as outsourced VPs of Sales providing sales management consulting and other outsourced sales solutions. They serve clients whose businesses teeter on the brink of failure and are often in dire need of rescue. These clients need the power of sales leadership to help avert imminent disaster and set a new course for success.
What superpowers do our fractional time sales leadership consultants engage as they rescue these struggling businesses? Here are some of the most common:
X-Ray Vision
It takes keen powers of observation to be a sales leader. But more than that, it takes clarity of vision and the ability to bring a powerful vision for sales direction into focus. Whether it be accurate sales forecasting, improved sales personnel, or a predictable sales process, our Advisors are able to see a better path to sales success. Their ability to see what others can’t see is often regarded as a critical superpower for sales leadership professionals.
Strength
Superheroes possess a personal strength of character with an unshakeable belief in the power of possibilities. Making those possibilities real, of course, requires strength in action. That strength includes not only the sales leader’s personal and professional fortitude, but also the wisdom for knowing when and how to deploy the right mix of powerful tools, systems, and resources.
Wisdom
Wisdom is more than merely a deep knowledge base. It’s also the acumen it takes to know how to use that knowledge in the right way to optimize sales results. It takes keen intellect, certainly, as well as the ability to learn quickly and apply these lessons correctly. This requires discernment: knowing what strategies and tools to use, when to use them, and when not to. This wisdom has typically been accumulated over 30+ years for each of our Advisors.
Laser focus
Top sales leaders work with a sense of purpose. They take on the tough challenges without blinking and keep their eyes on the prize as they maintain a steady aim at the right targets. They set their sights on a strategic course, reach their goals efficiently, and help others do the same.
Trustworthiness
Powerful sales leaders can be counted on to come in and save the day. They are dependable and accountable – and they expect the same from others. Each of our Advisors has been thoroughly vetted to make sure they have the educational, occupational and high integrity it takes to become part of Sales Xceleration.
Leadership
Using their unique superpowers, these Advisors rise to the occasion by being exceptional leaders. They can envision success, chart a course, adapt as needed, and help others see what they see. Because they manifest solutions to the daunting problems that would keep others from moving forward, they are well-equipped to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. They lead with communication, too, making it possible for others in the sales organization to take initiative and achieve lofty sales goals.
The Bottom Line:
Do you recognize any of these superpowers in your own arsenal? Are they traits and skills you’ve used in your professional life at the corporate level? Can you see yourself applying them to serve small to mid-sized businesses in need of rescue? Our licensed Sales Xceleration Advisors have done just that. They’ve pivoted from frustration in the corporate world to working (and leading) with purpose as they serve struggling businesses using their X-ray vision, personal and professional power, wisdom, laser focus, dependability, and leadership.
We all have superpowers. But only superheroes use these powers for extraordinary good. Are you ready to use your powers for greater purpose? To learn more about becoming a fractional time sales leadership consultant with Sales Xceleration, click here or contact us today at 844.874.7253.

Sales Xceleration was founded in 2011 by Mark Thacker and Chad Meyer, who both had successful careers in sales leadership and had both taken the entrepreneurial plunge to bring their skills to businesses in need in their community. They knew there were many other sales leaders who wanted to make a similar change, so they formed Sales Xceleration to provide sales consultants with their tools, processes, and insights that were gained as Outsourced VP of Sales. Mark and Chad remain significant owners in Sales Xceleration and will continue to be active within the company.

The companies are part of an investment strategy Firefly calls The Entrepreneurial Toolkit™, which seeks to identify, support, and grow world-class companies serving small to mid-size businesses with solutions that help attract and retain great people, win and keep loyal customers, and make more informed decisions with reliable data.

We welcomed the opportunity to partner with an organization that knows the rapidly growing fractional business model, is aligned with our core values, and is willing to invest in our growing business model.

https://salesxceleration.com/sales-team-effectiveness-navigating-pitfalls-for-maximum-impact/,"
     A high-performing sales team is the lifeblood of any organization, the driving force behind customer acquisition, revenue generation, and ultimately, company success. However, achieving and maintaining sales team effectiveness and efficiency in sales can be complex, with numerous potential pitfalls that could frustrate team members, hinder performance, and cause lost opportunities.
Here are four key areas where pitfalls can undermine efficiency in sales, along with ways to empower sales optimization for long-term growth:
Sales Training
Successful sales teams understand their product or service, target audience, and the most effective and efficient sales methods, including best practices in sales. Proper sales training can accelerate and help sustain this understanding. Too many organizations, however, fall short in developing sales performance training programs and effective sales techniques, often falling victim to these pitfalls:

Outdated training that fails to keep pace with market dynamics, current and emerging technologies, and competitor strategies
Generic sales training with a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address individual strengths, weaknesses, and needs
Theory-heavy sales training that lacks practical real-world application

To overcome these pitfalls, sales training should include:

Regular assessments to identify knowledge gaps
Active learning methods that promote engagement and personalized skill development
Insights, inspiration, and sales leadership from industry experts, company managers, and top performers
Integration of role-playing exercises, real-world case studies, and simulations
Investment in ongoing sales coaching and mentorship for continuous skill refinement

Looking for more? Visit our library of blogs dedicated to sales training.
Team Collaboration in Sales
A sales team doesn’t function in a vacuum. Rather, it can only thrive with effective collaboration between salespeople, team leaders, department managers, and peers within and outside the department.
Pitfalls lurk, however, and can undermine the best plans and intentions if not managed well. These sales optimization pitfalls include:

Development and tolerance of internal silos
Poor communication within the team and beyond department boundaries
Unhealthy internal competition that discourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving; ultimately leading to a toxic culture

Lack of trust can quickly fester and have a lasting impact on team health. However, these team productivity pitfalls can be overcome by executing key sales strategies:

Implementing CRM software and team communication tools that facilitate and simplify real-time information sharing
Establishing a team productivity culture where knowledge is shared and collaborative success is celebrated and rewarded
Encouraging teamwork and trust through role-playing and team-based challenges
Including team performance goals and metrics alongside individual targets


Performance Metrics for Sales Effectiveness
Effectively measuring sales performance is crucial for identifying areas for improvement and motivating the team. Done wrong, however, sales measurement pitfalls can emerge, including:

Overemphasizing short-term financial goal attainment at the expense of providing true solutions for customer needs
Failing to track essential customer relationship metrics that can gauge customer satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value
Ignoring important activity tracking – such as call volume, email engagement, meeting frequency, and progression within the pipeline – necessary to assess and fine-tune the effort behind the results

Ways to make sales metrics more meaningful and actionable include:

Implementing a “balanced scorecard” that includes sales volume, customer satisfaction metrics, and activity tracking
Tracking bigger-picture key performance indicators (sales KPIs) aligned with your overall sales strategy
Utilizing data visualization tools to offer clear insights into ROI in sales, as well as team and individual performance
Establishing sales optimization benchmarks and tracking progress with both leading and lagging indicators to identify trends and areas for improvement
Utilizing a well-designed and easy to use and maintain CRM software system to monitor the “right” metrics including conversion rates, average deal size, and customer acquisition cost
Monitoring sales performance analysis data for relevancy and alignment to goals, as well as actionability for improving weaknesses
Communicating performance metrics and results with team members to deliver constructive feedback and motivation

Motivational Team Building
A motivated sales team is a high-performing sales team. Motivated salespeople are more productive, persistent, and resilient in the face of challenges. However, common pitfalls can stifle motivational team building:

Unrealistic targets based on unachievable goals
Lack of recognition for dedicated effort and attained goals
Limited incentive programs for sales or career growth opportunities leaving top performers feeling undervalued and hopeless

Implementing these motivational techniques can help overcome such pitfalls:

Setting SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound – goals to provide a clear path to success
Implementing a recognition program that celebrates individual and team achievements
Offering professional development and career advancement opportunities
Fostering engagement and ownership by involving sales team members in decision-making and planning
Offering a well-structured commission plan to incentivize and reward top performance
Establishing a positive and supportive culture of open communication, performance recognition

     A high-performing sales team is the lifeblood of any organization, the driving force behind customer acquisition, revenue generation, and ultimately, company success. However, achieving and maintaining sales team effectiveness and efficiency in sales can be complex, with numerous potential pitfalls that could frustrate team members, hinder performance, and cause lost opportunities.
Here are four key areas where pitfalls can undermine efficiency in sales, along with ways to empower sales optimization for long-term growth:
Sales Training
Successful sales teams understand their product or service, target audience, and the most effective and efficient sales methods, including best practices in sales. Proper sales training can accelerate and help sustain this understanding. Too many organizations, however, fall short in developing sales performance training programs and effective sales techniques, often falling victim to these pitfalls:

Outdated training that fails to keep pace with market dynamics, current and emerging technologies, and competitor strategies
Generic sales training with a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address individual strengths, weaknesses, and needs
Theory-heavy sales training that lacks practical real-world application

To overcome these pitfalls, sales training should include:

Regular assessments to identify knowledge gaps
Active learning methods that promote engagement and personalized skill development
Insights, inspiration, and sales leadership from industry experts, company managers, and top performers
Integration of role-playing exercises, real-world case studies, and simulations
Investment in ongoing sales coaching and mentorship for continuous skill refinement

Team Collaboration in Sales
A sales team doesn’t function in a vacuum. Rather, it can only thrive with effective collaboration between salespeople, team leaders, department managers, and peers within and outside the department.
Pitfalls lurk, however, and can undermine the best plans and intentions if not managed well. These sales optimization pitfalls include:

Development and tolerance of internal silos
Poor communication within the team and beyond department boundaries
Unhealthy internal competition that discourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving; ultimately leading to a toxic culture

Lack of trust can quickly fester and have a lasting impact on team health. However, these team productivity pitfalls can be overcome by executing key sales strategies:

Implementing CRM software and team communication tools that facilitate and simplify real-time information sharing
Establishing a team productivity culture where knowledge is shared and collaborative success is celebrated and rewarded
Encouraging teamwork and trust through role-playing and team-based challenges
Including team performance goals and metrics alongside individual targets


Performance Metrics for Sales Effectiveness
Effectively measuring sales performance is crucial for identifying areas for improvement and motivating the team, strengthened through <a href=""https://salesxceleration.com/sales-leadership-training/""><strong>tailored sales leadership training programs</strong></a>. Done wrong, however, sales measurement pitfalls can emerge, including:

Overemphasizing short-term financial goal attainment at the expense of providing true solutions for customer needs
Failing to track essential customer relationship metrics that can gauge customer satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value
Ignoring important activity tracking – such as call volume, email engagement, meeting frequency, and progression within the pipeline – necessary to assess and fine-tune the effort behind the results

Ways to make sales metrics more meaningful and actionable include:

Implementing a “balanced scorecard” that includes sales volume, customer satisfaction metrics, and activity tracking
Tracking bigger-picture key performance indicators (sales KPIs) aligned with your overall sales strategy
Utilizing data visualization tools to offer clear insights into ROI in sales, as well as team and individual performance
Establishing sales optimization benchmarks and tracking progress with both leading and lagging indicators to identify trends and areas for improvement
Utilizing a well-designed and easy to use and maintain CRM software system to monitor the “right” metrics including conversion rates, average deal size, and customer acquisition cost
Monitoring sales performance analysis data for relevancy and alignment to goals, as well as actionability for improving weaknesses
Communicating performance metrics and results with team members to deliver constructive feedback and motivation

Motivational Team Building
A motivated sales team is a high-performing sales team. Motivated salespeople are more productive, persistent, and resilient in the face of challenges. However, common pitfalls can stifle motivational team building:

Unrealistic targets based on unachievable goals
Lack of recognition for dedicated effort and attained goals
Limited incentive programs for sales or career growth opportunities leaving top performers feeling undervalued and hopeless

Implementing these motivational techniques can help overcome such pitfalls:

Setting SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound – goals to provide a clear path to success
Implementing a recognition program that celebrates individual and team achievements
Offering professional development and career advancement opportunities
Fostering engagement and ownership by involving sales team members in decision-making and planning
Offering a well-structured commission plan to incentivize and reward top performance
Establishing a positive and supportive culture of open communication, performance recognition

Maximizing effectiveness and efficiency in sales requires navigating common pitfalls for maximum impact. By investing in comprehensive sales training, fostering team collaboration in sales, tracking metrics for sales effectiveness, and implementing motivational team building, you can unlock true sales optimization and power up your sales force.

https://salesxceleration.com/news-events/sales-xceleration-holds-1st-annual-conference/,"
     Over 25 Advisors from all over the United States traveled to Indianapolis recently for Sales Xceleration’s first Annual Conference. This year’s theme was Xcelerate Your Freedom. This theme was selected because every Advisor joins Sales Xceleration, in part, to pursue the freedoms they lack: financial freedom, control of their future, better work/life balance, a desire to “make a difference again,” the elimination of corporate bureaucracy, and the desire to utilize their accumulated wisdom and skills differently. A freedom that is quite different than what was important to us 10 to 20 years ago.
We gathered for the three-day event to share best practices, learn from each other, develop new relationships, and discover what Sales Xceleration has planned for the coming years – and with that many Sales VPs in one place, a little fun was also on the agenda, too. In addition, Advisors were introduced to three new product offerings to simplify their sales process and “xcelerate” not only their revenue, but their clients’ revenue as well!
Best Practices – Guest speakers presented on several issues affecting business owners in the small business market and how those issues impact our Advisors’ leadership roles when serving their clients. A few Sales Xceleration Advisors also presented their own best practices and success stories to share what they have learned with the rest of the team. These discussions were extremely well received, leaving all in attendance with new ideas on how to improve their own business. That’s the benefit of having over 800 years of sales experience in one room!
Advisor Collaboration – Sales Xceleration Advisors are the best and brightest sales leaders in the country, and the Annual Conference was the perfect venue to gather, toss ideas around the room, share experiences, and brainstorm future product offerings and Advisor support. Once again, the value of wisdom encompassing 800+ years spanning diverse industries was impressive, to say the least. We are truly excited about what the future holds for our Advisors and their clients!
Product Offerings – We were pleased to unveil three new products to our Advisors and their clients. They include:
1. An Online Diagnostic Tool – Sales Xceleration Advisors now have access to a totally customized Online Diagnostic Tool that rates the effectiveness of a business owner’s sales infrastructure in four key areas. It also expedites the discovery process of current Sales Xceleration offerings. Are you curious how your company would rate?
2. A Marketing Opportunity Locator – This tool provides a systematic, simple way to align and implement a sales strategy. It creates a target market map for an ideal customer, helping them understand who their core customers are, how to market directly to them, identification of their real competition, and the exact language their customers use to talk about their brand.
3. A Content Marketing Service – This product is instrumental to help businesses get their message out, builds their reputation as an expert and thought leader and identifies warm prospects who clearly demonstrate interest in their business. Our clients’ sales teams will now be able identify and penetrate new markets.
From the pre-conference activities (a golf outing or a behind-the-scenes tour of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway) to the closing remarks, excitement, energy and education were the common themes shared in a post-conference survey.
The conference was a huge success, in large part due to the active participation of our Advisors. Each Advisor has tremendous sales leadership experience and holds true to our Sales Xceleration Mission Statement:  Integrity, character and ethics, lived out in service for our clients.
Stay tuned for information on next year’s conference (the rumor on the street is it could be somewhere warm!)

     /**/
/**/When it comes to building a top-performing sales organization, it’s easy to say, “Surround yourself with the right people and the results will take care of themselves.” While it is true you’ll need competent, motivated performers working together to construct the foundations of sales success, there are other critical factors to nail down – sooner than later!
So, what are some essential building blocks to include in your sales organization blueprint? Here are the cornerstones:
Cornerstone #1: Understanding the Importance of a Sales Department
While arguments can be made for the importance of every department in a business, the bottom line is this: without sales, there is no revenue; and without revenue, there IS no business! Certainly then, the importance of a sales department cannot be understated. But being a revenue linchpin in the company also brings great responsibility – to get things right, make things work, and to perform as a team to maximize sales.
Do your sales leaders and managers and frontline reps feel the weight of this reality? If not, performance and sales results may falter regardless of how strongly the other cornerstones are constructed.
Cornerstone #2: Establishing the Principles of Your Sales Organization
Before you can seek to define and execute sales organization structure best practices, it is critical to establish the guiding principles of your sales organization. This can (and should) include alignment with the company’s overarching values, vision, and mission. Never forget your sales teams are the frontline ambassadors for your brand. Regardless of what your company’s marketing collateral says about its ideals, your sales reps can reinforce that foundation or make it crumble in their day-to-day interactions.
When communicating your principles internally, be sure to emphasize teamwork and respect. Even one disruptive outlier in your organization can cause frustration, disharmony, and chaos. Consider using a team-oriented mantra and make sure each team member embodies its spirit every day and with each customer interface.

Cornerstone #3: Building the Structure of Your Sales Organization for Maximum Performance
Just as a building’s strength depends on proper materials and construction, it is just as critical that your sales department’s organizational structure be well-designed and built to withstand forces both external and internal. While your people are perhaps the most critical components – impacting culture, morale, sales results, and revenue – even the most competent sales performers cannot thrive in a poorly designed work environment.
So, make sure your sales department organizational structure makes sense with properly aligned responsibilities and territories that are matched to the skills of your sales team members.
Cornerstone #4: Using Metrics and Accountability to Drive Motivation and Results
Even the most functional sales structure is not sustainable if sales reps are not equipped to succeed, properly motivated, and held accountable to maximize results. Of course, this starts by letting them know what is expected of them. Establish reasonable “stretch” goals and use appropriate key performance indicators, or KPIs, to measure progress and success. When possible, KPIs for the sales department should include leading indicators as well as lagging indicators; this will help your team make necessary corrections in real-time to maximize employee performance.
Of course, performance accountability is essential to sustainable success. By identifying weak points in your sales department organizational structure, you can shore up deficiencies by delivering additional training, implementing new resources, and changing territories and responsibilities to match individual strengths. If necessary (usually as a last resort), you can always replace poor performers with new sales talent.
The Bottom Line:
A well-designed, carefully constructed, and effectively managed sales organization can help your company improve decision-making, enhance sales team performance, and boost revenue and profit. Your sales organization’s blueprint should start with the cornerstones noted here, but there are many critical details and dimensions to be laid out as well.
Our fractional sales leadership consultants, serving as Advisors and often as Outsourced VPs of Sales, can help you establish sales organization structure best practices and draft a blueprint for sustainable sales success.

How to Unstick a Stalled Deal (Even if it Means No Deal at All)

Don’t Prescribe a Sales Solution Before You Diagnose the Problem

The One-Two Punch for Consulting Success: Strategic Partnerships Plus Word-of-Mouth


    ","
     /**/
/**/When it comes to building a top-performing sales organization, it’s easy to say, “Surround yourself with the right people and the results will take care of themselves.” While it is true you’ll need competent, motivated performers working together to construct the foundations of sales success, there are other critical factors to nail down – sooner than later!
So, what are some essential building blocks to include in your sales organization blueprint? Here are the cornerstones:
Cornerstone #1: Understanding the Importance of a Sales Department
While arguments can be made for the importance of every department in a business, the bottom line is this: without sales, there is no revenue; and without revenue, there IS no business! Certainly then, the importance of a sales department cannot be understated. But being a revenue linchpin in the company also brings great responsibility – to get things right, make things work, and to perform as a team to maximize sales.
Do your sales leaders and managers and frontline reps feel the weight of this reality? If not, performance and sales results may falter regardless of how strongly the other cornerstones are constructed.
Cornerstone #2: Establishing the Principles of Your Sales Organization
Before you can seek to define and execute sales organization structure best practices, it is critical to establish the guiding principles of your sales organization. This can (and should) include alignment with the company’s overarching values, vision, and mission. Never forget your sales teams are the frontline ambassadors for your brand. Regardless of what your company’s marketing collateral says about its ideals, your sales reps can reinforce that foundation or make it crumble in their day-to-day interactions.
When communicating your principles internally, be sure to emphasize teamwork and respect. Even one disruptive outlier in your organization can cause frustration, disharmony, and chaos. Consider using a team-oriented mantra and make sure each team member embodies its spirit every day and with each customer interface.

Cornerstone #3: Building the Structure of Your Sales Organization for Maximum Performance
Just as a building’s strength depends on proper materials and construction, it is just as critical that your sales department’s organizational structure be well-designed and built to withstand forces both external and internal. While your people are perhaps the most critical components – impacting culture, morale, sales results, and revenue – even the most competent sales performers cannot thrive in a poorly designed work environment.
So, make sure your sales department organizational structure makes sense with properly aligned responsibilities and territories that are matched to the skills of your sales team members.
Cornerstone #4: Using Metrics and Accountability to Drive Motivation and Results
Even the most functional sales structure is not sustainable if sales reps are not equipped to succeed, properly motivated, and held accountable to maximize results. Of course, this starts by letting them know what is expected of them. Establish reasonable “stretch” goals and use appropriate key performance indicators, or KPIs, to measure progress and success. When possible, KPIs for the sales department should include leading indicators as well as lagging indicators; this will help your team make necessary corrections in real-time to maximize employee performance.
Of course, performance accountability is essential to sustainable success.

     Fresh starts and new beginnings are always possible. It merely takes a dream, desire, and drive. And perhaps a small dose of courage. Simple, right? Of course not. But stepping out of your comfort zone and into the realm of possibility might just yield the kind of rewards that can only come from finding your purpose. If this all sounds unrealistic or out of reach, consider John’s story:
The Backstory
For nearly 15 years, John worked as VP of Sales for his corporate employer. Throughout his tenure, John and his team consistently delivered on the promise of sales excellence. In fact, for 10 years in a row, John’s team produced year-over-year revenue growth of more than a million dollars. This kind of solid, predictable performance became the foundation for the company’s success and position as a market leader. Everything was going great until…
Everything Changes
Just when things seem safe and orderly and reliable, trouble can strike and shake the foundations of success. For John’s company – a food services provider to businesses in several large metropolitan areas across the U.S. – the culprit was COVID and the resulting economic downfall. When the pandemic struck, John’s company, like so many others, was blindsided as business virtually ground to a halt.
Several of their clients, including their largest customer, suddenly implemented work-from-home policies. With workers no longer congregating in office buildings, this wiped out much of the company’s business, causing sales to drop by almost 60%. Naturally, this new economic reality caused an operational upheaval and undercut the possibility of continuing the company’s long track record of growth.
Tough decisions had to be made and made quickly if the company were to survive. Budgets were cut and two-thirds of John’s team, along with most of the marketing team, were let go. Operating with a “skeleton crew,” John suddenly found himself doing a lot less leading and a lot more damage control. He was constantly putting out fires without the support his team needed to be effective.
The Decision
After decades in sales and with an enviable reputation as a sales leader, John, now in his 50s, found himself in uncharted and undesirable territory. Everything he had worked so hard for – all his successes, all the challenges he had overcome, all the wisdom and operational intellect he had acquired – suddenly seemed devalued. Faced with this new reality, John had a decision to make.
The decision began with some questions: Am I happy with what I am doing? Will I ever again feel respected and appreciated in this new corporate environment? Can I truly work with a sense of purpose if I don’t make a change?
For John, the answer to all of these questions was no! He couldn’t see himself being happy with the status quo. He couldn’t imagine feeling respected and appreciated in the new normal of the post-pandemic workplace. And he didn’t feel he could find a sense of purpose – and make a difference – unless he sought a better path.
The Better Path
John’s story is common to many other sales executives with years of senior leadership experience. They invested so much of their lives for their corporate employers only to find themselves feeling unchallenged, disrespected, and undervalued. Still, they know they have so much more to offer – especially to business owners who desperately need their expertise and guidance in the new economic landscape.
Ultimately, for John and so many other sales leaders, the better path they sought led to a career as a sales leadership consultant. So many of the prospective new licensed Sales Xceleration Advisors we speak with want a new beginning where they control their future. A future with flexibility to set their own hours and write their own paycheck. Simply put, another corporate “W2” job is not going to satisfy them anymore.
Could they buy a franchise in a new field? Sure, but ultimately, they discover that their years of sales leadership experience is the perfect foundation for success in the field they’ve already invested their lives in. So, like John, they take a closer look at sales leadership consulting. What they find is that small to mid-sized businesses are eager to pay well for their sales wisdom and guidance. In particular, owners of these businesses appreciate being able to engage sales leadership consultants on a fractional basis; that is, part-time and/or for a limited duration service engagement, to help them make the right moves.
Best of all, our licensed Advisors who use the proven tools, resources, and systems of Sales Xceleration have a 97% success rate! So, if you, like John, find yourself in a frustrating new reality and seek a fresh start, a new beginning where you can find your professional purpose and make a difference for others, we invite you to explore the Sales Xceleration opportunity as a fractional sales leadership consultant.

https://salesxceleration.com/7-essential-tips-for-interviewing-top-sales-talent/,"
     Recruiting and hiring salespeople can be quite challenging given the importance the role plays in generating revenue for the business and ultimately the success of the company. When I first began serving in this capacity, it was evident that the success of the salesperson was heavily dependent on if the individual demonstrated their ability to sell the products and services to the target audience. In other words, having the fundamental knowledge and skills is critical in the hire.
However, I soon discovered that this assumption and approach had some serious flaws. While considering their understanding of the buyer persona was on the right track, predominantly focusing on specific competitors or similar companies was a mistake.
Discerning how to interact with a specific buyer persona is difficult to teach and learn, so this is a worthy quality to seek in a candidate. However, knowledge of products and services is something any quality salesperson can study and learn to be successful. Removing this focus dramatically increases sales recruiting success.
Focus on these seven items while interviewing top sales talent to improve your hiring:
1. Culture Fit
Salespeople must fit into the company culture to a high degree (50%+) or there is a greater potential for internal conflict. Since salespeople often rely on other staff to close business, culture fit is important to have synergy.
2. Open Mindedness
Create an Ideal Candidate Profile (ICP) that captures the qualities of an individual who can serve your buyer persona and fits the company culture. This exercise will help you remain open-minded when evaluating candidates by remaining focused on the criteria you established when evaluating candidates.
3. In-person Interviews
While remote sales positions are commonplace, it is important to have final interviews in person to best evaluate the candidate even if it increases hiring costs. It is easier to accurately evaluate salespeople in person to pick up on their traits.
4. Top Traits
Determine the character traits that are most important and ask questions that bring these traits to light. Examples of traits include accountable, competitive, confident, honest, likable, creative thinker, integrity, etc.
5. Compensation
High-quality salespeople are motivated by money and growth potential. Presenting their earning potential and comp plan structure will help entice the candidates with the greatest success potential.
6. Wins and Losses
Top salespeople vividly remember their best wins and worst losses. Having candidates describe an example of each allows you to see obstacles that were overcome, if they attribute success to help from others, as well as what was learned in the loss scenario.
7. Entice
Part of hiring is showcasing the company and role. Be sure to enthusiastically highlight the best parts of the company, culture, products, services, etc. to attract top talent.
The Bottom Line
Recruiting top sales talent is a critical component of driving business success, and by focusing on these seven essential tips, you can significantly enhance your hiring process. Implementing these strategies will help you identify candidates who not only have the necessary skills but also align with your company’s values and goals. As you refine your recruitment efforts, I encourage you to apply these insights and share your own experiences and tips on hiring exceptional sales talent. Your contributions can further enrich the collective knowledge on effective sales recruitment practices.

     Is Your Sales Team Struggling to Hit Their Sales Goals? 
Sales goals are essential in business, but evaluation and adjustment are equally as important. The end of Q1 is a great time to adjust if the sales numbers are not on track.
Many sales plans heavily weight closed deals in Q1 because these sales will generate revenue for the remaining nine months of the year while closes in the other quarters have less impact on year end totals.
But how do you make the adjustments that will get your team back on track?
Here are four steps to take:

Reevaluate Your Sales Process 

Is your sales process a documented and defined process that identifies the steps a lead progresses through to become a client? It should look something like this (most products have a unique sales process determined by the market, customer and service or product being sold):

Once the sales process is defined and documented, it can be measured. Establish ratios like these:

How many leads are needed to get a demo?
How many demos are needed to get an opportunity?
How many opportunities are needed to get a new client?


Manage Activity

Once the key ratios are established, determine the amount of activity needed to hit the annual goal. By managing activity, the results are driven rather waiting for the results and hoping the sales team is doing the right activities to generate them.

Coach for Better Execution

More importantly, look for ways in which ratios can be improved through additional training or improved execution. If the team has multiple sales reps, identify who is best at each stage of the sales process and have them share what they do. By continuously improving the execution of the sales process, sales growth will occur by both getting more leads and having a higher close rate.

Use Technology 

A customized CRM can help you develop good sales ratios, key metrics and KPIs. These will focus the sales team on the right activities to generate the sales results you need to hit your goals.

     Do you consider yourself a person of action, a doer, an achiever? Are you an intellectual? A visionary? A maverick? If so, you are a unique breed, especially if you’ve harbored or maintained such an independent mindset deep into your professional life. You see, most of us are born to (or conditioned to) play it safe – at least for a while. It starts with the primal base levels of “Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs” – physiological needs such as food, water, shelter, and clothing; safety needs such as employment, health, and property; and love and belonging needs such as friends, family, and a sense of connection. Once these are attained, many people go into a kind of autopilot; they believe that good enough is, well, good enough. They get lazy, perhaps, content to cocoon inside their “comfort zone.”
But not people like you! Here’s what I mean:
For you – for us – another word for comfort zone is “rut.” Yet another synonym might be “prison.” If we stop nurturing our personal and professional development, we might become prisoners to traditional trappings of success: 2-story house, nice car, well-manicured lawn, etc. But for doers, achievers, and visionary mavericks like us, we yearn for more. Deep down, we crave a challenge, even if we suppress the urge to scratch that itch. Even then, we look on with awe and admiration as our friends and professional peers embrace something new. As they take a bold step. Do something surprising. Take on the world. They seem to “have it all” and yet they seek more. They step outside the routine. They climb from their rut. They break free of their self-imposed prison.
Frankly, these inspirational role models aren’t making a desperate play to find success. In fact, they’ve already reached a level of accomplishment many would envy. Rather, they are simply heeding the call to reach the top of Mount Maslow (self-actualization and transcendence). They are daring to work with purpose. To follow their passion. To make a difference.
Self-actualization
Near the top of Maslow’s pyramid is the need for self-actualization. Again, many people never reach this stage, nor put much thought or effort into achieving it. Just what IS self-actualization? Think of it as reaching your full potential. This is the stage where achievers pursue that keen desire to become all they are capable of becoming – particularly in focused pursuits, anything from parenting to artistic endeavors to business success and leadership. It is at the self-actualization level where skills and talents (innate, learned, or developed and mastered) find their manifestation.
Transcendence
Abraham Maslow later subdivided the pyramid’s top section to include transcendence, or spiritual needs. He noted that “transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating … to oneself [and] to … others.” Thus, he saw that transcendence brings a greater sense of fulfillment, a deep sense of connection and purpose that can – by purposeful action – create a higher, more noble, level of achievement.
The Bottom Line:
Some people are content to lead ordinary lives within ordinary comfort zones. Others, however, yearn for more. They seek to become all they can be, via self-actualization and transcendence. Certainly, this upper echelon of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is the realm of visionary mavericks. It’s where achievers hear that call they must heed – an incessant knocking on a door that must be opened. It’s where passion and purpose and pride fully mesh. It’s where fulfillment happens. It’s where leaders dwell. And it’s where lives are changed.
At Sales Xceleration, our licensed Advisors have heard that knocking and seized the opportunity to work with passion and purpose to make a difference for others – in particular for owners of small to mid-sized businesses desperate for fractional sales leadership. If you have this same kind of irrepressible yearning for self-actualization and transcendence in your life as a sales leadership professional, let’s connect. Opportunities are open in all markets.

     We often hear from corporate sales leaders who join our team of licensed Advisors that they believe they are investing in their future. We’re honored they see it that way (and we couldn’t agree more!). Our Advisors are often impressed by our continuing investment in the development of essential sales consulting tools, resources, systems, and training. This type of ongoing investment is a key reason Sales Xceleration® continues to grow – rapidly. In fact, we’ve been named to Inc. Magazine’s list of the 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies in America for three straight years.
What’s more, we believe investment – of time, energy, passion, and yes, money – is the rocket fuel that propels success to new heights. And that’s why we’re particularly excited to announce a new kind of partnership investment that brings even greater success opportunities to Sales Xceleration and our licensed Advisors. What is this new investment, and what does it mean for our team and for you?
Details of the Investment and Partnership
Since its founding in 2011 by Mark Thacker and Chad Meyer, Sales Xceleration has been on a rapid growth trajectory. Not only has that been recognized by Inc. Magazine, but it’s also drawn attention from the investment community. On October 12, 2021, the time and opportunity were right for Sales Xceleration to enter into an investment relationship with The Firefly Group, a firm with a proven track record of partnering with leadership teams to build companies of lasting value.
With its investment, Firefly becomes the majority partner in Sales Xceleration. However, Mark and Chad will remain significant owners in Sales Xceleration and will continue to be active within the company. Mark will be on the Board of Directors. Otherwise, Sales Xceleration will continue business as usual, continuing to operate in the manner that created the investment-worthy exceptional year-over-year growth. The strategic and tactical direction remain the same, and the same corporate employees will continue to serve the Advisor and client communities as well as managing corporate outreach and growth initiatives. Best of all, Advisors will continue to be empowered by the same set of tools and resources.
A Strategic Alliance
The investment in Sales Xceleration is part of a strategy Firefly calls The Entrepreneurial Toolkit™, which seeks to identify, support, and grow world-class companies serving small to mid-size businesses. Sales Xceleration will complement Firefly’s other platform investment in EOS Worldwide (EOS®), which also serves entrepreneurial businesses. EOS serves clients with its Entrepreneurial Operating System, a set of concepts and tools used by more than 100,000 global companies to clarify, simplify, and achieve their vision. Sales Xceleration, Firefly, and EOS share similar corporate cultures and values; and they complement one another in their pioneering fractional consulting experience and commitment to serving small to mid-sized businesses.
David Mann, Firefly’s co-founder, and partner said, “We couldn’t be more pleased to join with Sales Xceleration in the next phase of its growth. Its proven fractional services model fills a void in the marketplace left by the shortage of great sales leadership across small and mid-sized companies.
Extra Value for Advisors – Present and Future
What does this new partnership mean for current and future Advisors? While Sales Xceleration will carry forward its strategic and tactical direction and continue to provide Advisors with its robust and growing suite of tools and resources, the Firefly investment will enable that growth to accelerate, bringing significantly greater benefits to our licensed sales leadership consultants.
First, it confirms the value and forecasted growth of the fractional services model. In other words, it’s a notable further endorsement of the Sales Xceleration model that’s driven our continuing growth.
Next, because of the synergistic alignment between Sales Xceleration and EOS, new opportunities within shared and related markets are likely. A tight connection with EOS will provide new ways to add value for clients.
What’s more, the Firefly investment brings additional validation when collaborating with other strategic partners and clients. In fact, it can bring an extra measure of credibility and influence necessary to open doors for client work with PE/investment companies.
The Bottom Line:
With Firefly’s support, we are excited to continue expanding our footprint throughout the world and add even more value for our licensed Advisors.

     You’ve seen them on mall directory maps; you’ve seen them on state maps in rest area display cases; you’ve even seen them on online maps when you need directions… I’m talking about those tags, flags, and symbols that indicate “You are here.” But while each of these provides an important reference point, I believe the most important thing to remember about “You Are Here” indicators is this:
Where you are is a starting point for where you will go next.
So, ask yourself, “Am I stuck in place? Is this really where I want to remain? And if not,  where do I want to go from here?” These valid life questions are no less important when it comes to examining “second act” choices for your professional sales leadership career. Are you stuck in place, professionally? Are you at a place in your career arc that satisfies and fulfills you? And if you yearn for more, do your dreams give you a sense of direction for your future?
Feeling Stuck?
Have you reached a point in your sales leadership career where you feel unrespected? Not valued? Not challenged? In a rut and burned out? If so, you’re certainly not alone. Many of us have reached a point of dissatisfaction and restlessness. We yearn for more and seek new challenges. We want to feel like we matter again. And yet, here we are, stuck, like that “You Are Here” pin.
But remember, just because you feel stuck doesn’t mean you must remain where you are. I’ll repeat this because it’s super important:
Where you are is a starting point for where you will go next.
Castles in the Air
Henry David Thoreau advised us to “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you’ve imagined.” Good motivational nudge, right? But where do you start? Thoreau also said “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.” The good news is that if you’ve worked hard to build a successful sales leadership career, you’ve already constructed the track record of success that becomes a sturdy foundation for where you go from here. To start, all you must do is open your mind to the fact that you can use your hard-earned wisdom to move in a new professional direction.
Go Confidently in the Direction of Your Dreams
Sadly, many sales executives think they must leave behind what they learned and accomplished in the first half of their professional life when pursuing their next chapter of sales leadership success. Not true! As the late Bob Buford notes in his book, Halftime, “You can apply your gifts in ways that allow you to spend more time on things [that matter]. And do it in such a way as to reclaim the thrill of that first deal!” In other words, you can recapture that lost energy and excitement you thought was long gone. You can use your skills and talents and experience to form a solid foundation for the castles in the air that constitute your dreams!
What do I know about your dreams? Well, I know this much: So many of the successful sales leaders I’ve spoken to and met with over the years have told me they are proud of what they’ve accomplished but they feel they have more to give. They want to feel a sense of significance, to know they matter, to work with a sense of real purpose. They’ve told me they want to find their own fulfillment but also make a difference for others. These are the common whisperings of so many inner voices, urging them to remember that “You Are Here” doesn’t mean this is where you must remain.
The Bottom Line:
Years ago, sales leaders had to venture into their second acts without a clear-cut path. Today’s sales leaders who are ready to move on from their corporate careers, however, have a “GPS” to help them move confidently in the direction of their dreams. As hundreds of successful sales leaders have discovered, Sales Xceleration makes it easier to navigate the sales leadership consulting landscape. Using Sales Xceleration’s proven tools, resources, and systems, our licensed Advisors serve small to mid-sized businesses that need to build a sales engine and create record-breaking growth. As fractional time Outsourced VPs of Sales, they work with purpose, achieve a sense of significance, spend less time on the road and more time with family – and truly make a difference for businesses in need.

     You’ve seen them on mall directory maps; you’ve seen them on state maps in rest area display cases; you’ve even seen them on online maps when you need directions… I’m talking about those tags, flags, and symbols that indicate “You are here.” But while each of these provides an important reference point, I believe the most important thing to remember about “You Are Here” indicators is this:
Where you are is a starting point for where you will go next.

     All B2B companies have a sales pipeline, but few small and mid sized business owners can rely on it to run their business. Many companies who struggle with sales also lack an accurate sales forecast. I work with business owners every day who are trying to get a handle on their pipeline and improve the performance of their sales team. Sales is the “heartbeat” of every company, but without a systematic way to account for your prospects and new business, you will never have a handle on your sales. Let’s start by understanding the cost of an inaccurate sales pipeline and what you can do to fix it.
What is the business cost of an inaccurate sales pipeline?

You can’t forecast your new/future business.
You can’t build KPIs that provide leading indicators of performance.
You can’t evaluate your sales plan and the gaps related to achieve it.
You can’t manage the performance of the sales team or the sales leader.
You can’t plan operational resources including people and materials needed for future work.

You can solve these problems by creating a detailed, systematic, and accurate sales pipeline. Here are 6 key areas you must fix first:

Use a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) to build and track your sales pipeline. Excel spreadsheets and other homemade systems are not dynamic enough to track and report your pipeline data. Fun fact: HubSpot reports that most organizations are spending substantially more on sales technology than they did two years ago. https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics
Create a documented sales process that has all of the steps your company takes to close a sale. Map this sales process to the opportunity/deal stages in a CRM.
Include a forecasting methodology including opportunity amounts, close dates, and probabilities of closure.
Provide sales leadership to manage the sales pipeline and forecast weekly.
Develop KPIs to track activities related to the pipeline, including emails, phone calls, and prospect meetings. Incorporate these KPIs into your CRM dashboard for visibility.
Remember that your sales pipeline and system are only as good as the sales team inputs, so “garbage in is garbage out.” You must inspect what you expect and measure accuracy of sales team members. Consistency is key!

If you address the issues above, you can master your sales pipeline and rely on it to forecast performance and make better business decisions!

https://salesxceleration.com/7-ways-to-make-your-smart-goals-smarter-and-more-effective-than-ever/,"
     Few sales principles have reached the near-universal adoption of SMART goals. Almost everyone understands the wisdom of establishing and pursuing goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely. But do these performance-driven characteristics go far enough? If your goals are merely SMART, it’s possible you are leaving competitive advantages on the table. Let’s take things up a notch. Here are seven ways to make your SMART goals even SMARTER.
Specific and Simple
SMART goals are specific, and that’s important. There must be absolute clarity when asking a sales rep to meet quotas and objectives. SMARTER goals go a step beyond to also keep things Simple. While specific goals can be measured, simple goals can be fully understood and bought into. When setting sales goals and sales performance criteria, take extra time to simplify how the goals are stated. Any confusion will inevitably lead to poor performance and sluggish sales, so aim for unmistakable clarity. In other words, keep it simple, smarty!
Measurable and Motivating
Sales goals should be measurable. After all, if you can’t measure results, you can’t really know when you’ve hit your targets. But goals that are specific and measurable can sometimes also seem daunting and not worth the effort. That is, unless you take extra care to also craft them to be Motivating. How? Well, you’ll first want to understand what energizes and encourages your sales team. That will take some engagement, insight, and communication. Once you know what motivates your sales reps (money, perks, trips, incentives, recognition, etc.) you can craft your goals to reference these elements. This might require going beyond simply stated goals to also including tangible sales rep benefits.
Attainable and Affordable
Nearly all goals can be reached. With concentrated effort, the right team, and the right supporting resources, even the loftiest sales goals are within reach. But at what cost? If attaining goals – through exorbitant spending on talent and resources – blows the budget, where is the real bottom-line benefit? So, when setting SMARTER sales goals, make sure you consider the cost/benefit ratio and make them Affordable. If the cost of achieving certain sales goals is too high, rethink those goals.
Realistic and Rewarding
Realistic goals are related to specific and attainable goal setting. Likewise, Rewarding goals are related to motivational goals. To make your goals rewarding, go beyond motivation to consider the element of the reward. Answer this: What’s in it for the sales rep to achieve each sales goal? While each objective doesn’t necessarily need to have a specific line-item reward, it can be worthwhile to at least let sales reps know how much each goal factors into bigger-picture personal benefits. For example, perhaps growing the pipeline a defined amount is worth 20% of meeting performance objectives. Perhaps advancing a certain number of mid-pipeline prospects to bottom-of-the-funnel status is worth another 15%, and so on. By associating goal attainment with the reward, you draw a clearer line between performance and outcome.
Timely and Targetable
SMART goals are timely or time bound. In other words, they associate expectations with specific timelines and deadlines. But SMARTER goals also apply this specificity to Targetable action – to where sales effort can be directed to achieve desired results. While aligning expectations with targets may be more focused and specific within sales strategies and sales processes, you can also make note of targets in your stated goals. Targeted prospect or customer segments can be noted by territory, market, or by product or service line (or as a combination of these elements). Regardless of the segment specifics, by referencing targets in your goal setting, you can enhance clarity and reduce the likelihood of misdirected effort.
And Now for that Extra E and R…
To go beyond SMART Goals, you still need just a little something more, right? You need that extra E and that extra R…
SMARTER goals should also be Empowering. This goes beyond motivating, to encouraging sales reps to take measured risks. This can be tricky, because sales reps must understand that with the empowerment of risk-taking authority comes additional accountability and scrutiny regarding ethical standards. In other words, you can – by how you strategically set and state your goals – give sales reps the authority and freedom to attain those goals as long as they act responsibly.
And finally, SMARTER goals should be Responsive. This simply means that your goals should be adaptable to factors beyond the sales rep’s control. While this could be as simple as having the flexibility to eliminate certain goals if warranted, it can and should also mean that contingencies are built in when goals are set. SMARTER goals can pivot in response to market conditions. For instance, setting better sales goals that are responsive might have made sales rep objectives easier to modify during the economic crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. While not every market complication can be foreseen, sales goal responsiveness to those complications can be built in.
The Bottom Line:
SMART goals provide an excellent foundation for achieving sales success. But SMARTER goals will take sales performance up a notch.

When (and Why) the Sales Manager Should Simply Be Quiet

Using the 3 Cs to Improve Sales Performance

Planning to Coast through the End of the Year? Big Mistake. Here’s Why:

How Silence Can Help You Sell More


    ",customized sales leadership training,customized,insert_contextual_clause,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/why-outsourcing-leadership-roles-is-the-best-business-decision-you-can-make/,"
     Many think of traditional leaders as those who sit in board rooms by day and their offices by night. When you think of a leader, you often think of someone who checks in occasionally but otherwise stays stuck in meetings all day or out in the field themselves.
Not anymore. In a post-COVID world that relies on digital solutions more than ever before, there has been a major shift to an outsourced, fractional sales model. More and more, companies are becoming comfortable with an outsourced sales leader, whom they pay for a “fraction” of their time but for the whole scope of work they’d have full-time leaders do.
What is the distinction between the fractional model and the traditional one, then? Fractional executives take on the same strategic and tactical roles as full-time executives — they just do so part-time. They leverage their past meaningful leadership experience to build strategic plans, create company visions, make tactical plans to achieve overarching goals, and manage the teams who work to achieve those goals.
An outsourced CMO, for instance, builds a marketing plan, determines the best tactics and strategies for the firm to use that year, and then helps implement them. Because there aren’t as many operational or logistical hindrances to their work, fractional executives can accomplish their important work in part of the time and with even more of the focus — making them the answer to the question, “How can a small business compete with big business?”
Fractional sales leaders, specifically, take on all the same leadership roles and responsibilities as their in-house counterparts. They hire the salespeople, travel with them, run sales meetings, and conduct weekly individual pipeline reviews. Even though they are physically present only a “fraction” of the time, they make themselves available throughout the week for all tactical questions and details.
All of this sounds great in theory, but the concept of fractional sales leadership still leaves some people with reservations. Why? Start by understanding the differing points of view on the value of generalist versus specialist leaders.
The Generalist vs. Specialist Debate
Fractional sales leadership is rooted in the idea that it’s better to leverage a specialist for sales leadership than a generalist. For example, small business owners usually run their own sales operations. But what if the owner isn’t inherently a sales leader? What if he or she just has great ideas and the ability to implement them from an operational standpoint? In that case, the leader’s time is much better spent overseeing operational issues than focusing on a departmental area that they don’t enjoy and lack the expertise in.
This reflects a broader trend in the evolution of leadership during the age of digital hiring. No longer is the focus only on hiring full-time employees, but rather on finding the right talent for a role, no matter whether they are an employee, freelancer, consultant, or fractional leader. In this way, society continues to distinguish between generalist versus specialist. Why pay a salary to someone who can do a generalist role over a longer period versus someone more specialized? Even if you have to pay that specialist more, he or she is likely to do the job better, more efficiently, and in less time.
The timing has never been better to shift to a fractional model, especially as so many businesses are still bearing the brunt of the pandemic, recession, and the reduced cash flow that resulted from it. Now, the best talent is more difficult to obtain than ever before. Companies, then, have to ensure that their leaders have handled crises in the past and are seasoned, strategic professionals who can also dig their companies out of hardships in the future. Specialists are the best way to do that.
What Are the Benefits of a Fractional Executive?
The benefits of leadership experience are myriad when it comes to handling crises and leading small businesses through even the hardest times. Small businesses benefit from someone who has led large sales teams, been responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, dealt with complex sales cycles, and led teams to meet large corporate goals with tremendous pressure on them to do so. They have been “through the fire” before, so managing a less complex business is easy by comparison.
Unfortunately, many small businesses compete with larger corporations that have equally large budgets and can acquire the best talent available. Small businesses are left to compete without the luxury of being able to afford “the best of the best.”
Hiring someone fractionally levels the playing field for small businesses. This approach allows them to acquire top talent and only pay for the amount of time needed — which, because of the size and complexity of the business, is usually less than full-time. You can’t expect a high school basketball team to compete against an NBA team. A fractional leadership model ensures you aren’t trying to do that with your business.
A high-level VP of sales will make $250,000 to $350,000 per year, on average. A small business typically doesn’t have the cash flow to afford that high-priced executive, but it can afford $100,000+ for that same person for a fraction of their time. And given the reduced size of their sales team and the reduced revenue responsibility, an experienced sales leader can lead a small team in a fraction of the full-time capacity that a large corporation would require. These are just a few of the benefits of outsourcing.
Still, it can be challenging for entrepreneurs to understand the timing to make new strategic hires to scale their businesses. In more traditional models, new hires were seen as expenses rather than investments because the hire’s cost typically outweighed the business value they could contribute. That’s why the fractional executive model is such a game changer for small businesses. Now, hiring new sales talent can be a true investment. The new “fractional” leader comes at a fraction of the time and price, giving the entrepreneur more control over expectations for the time allotted and holding all parties accountable for success.
To illustrate the success of the fractional sales model, consider the following case study examples. These are true stories of a manufacturing company and an IT services company (the names of which have been changed) that found success in outsourcing leadership.
Case Study #1: Acme Manufacturing Co.
The Challenge
Acme Manufacturing faced numerous challenges to its productivity. The company lacked leadership and the accountability that comes with it. Without strong tactical leadership, Acme’s sales team became extremely reactive instead of proactive. They lagged in follow-ups with prospects, didn’t enter customer relationship management (CRM) data correctly or on time, and had no metrics, goals, quotas, or forecasts against which to measure their success.
Acme’s leadership knew the sales team was struggling. It wasn’t hitting its numbers, and growth was stagnant. But without a repeatable sales process in place, it was almost impossible for company leaders to figure out what was wrong when a sales process was never conducted the same way twice. Sales were happening differently every time, depending on which sales rep handled the account, and that led to a fragmented system of operations. And without goals or quotas in place, they couldn’t gauge the effectiveness of their sales personnel. Leaders were generally left to rely on their perceptions of salespeople’s success rather than black-and-white results measured against benchmarks.
The Solution
To address these challenges with the sales team, Acme Manufacturing decided to transition its previous sales manager and hire a fractional VP of sales. With an experienced sales leader, Acme could take advantage of the benefits of leadership experience. Because she had helped companies in similar situations before, the new VP of sales immediately knew what to do. She implemented much-needed systems for metrics, goals, CRM customization, revenue forecasts, accountability, and key performance indicators. While the sales team had been complacent in the past due to lack of direction, the new sales leader was committed to motivating them to proactively pursue new leads, track and enter data correctly, and follow leaders through to becoming customers.
The fractional VP of sales developed forecasting tools and methodology, establishing best practices for weekly sales team meetings (one-on-one individual meetings), CRM usage, client follow-up, time-to-quote, and phone and email communication. Specifically, she implemented a team “covenant” describing how each member will work with and treat other members, with an accountability requirement. By bolstering accountability and communication, the new sales leader helped light a fire under the team to perform and communicate better. She also produced Acme’s first-ever Q4 rolling forecast and implemented the company’s first variable compensation plan to better incentivize salespeople.
The Results
In one year, Acme’s business grew from $20 million to $28 million and increased gross margin by 18%. As a direct result of the fractional VP of sales hire, Acme created a highly functioning and effective sales team and even had the resources to hire an additional outside salesperson. It implemented a minimum 30% gross profit model for all products without significant loss of clients or revenue, as well as dashboards for significant metrics that were visible to the entire sales team. Corporate and divisional management adopted a VOIP phone system to track calls and add to the CRM and increase efficiency and accountability.
Once the company hired the fractional VP of sales, the owner was left to focus on what he did best: oversee the manufacturing process. And he acquired top tactical leadership talent to focus on sales for a fraction of the price it would have cost to bring on a full-time sales leader.
Case Study #2: Intelligence IT Services
The Challenge
Intelligence IT Services was suffering from serious underperformance in sales. The company had no sales culture and no sales team, and its consultants thought they knew everything (but their strength was not actually selling). To make matters worse, Intelligence IT was not leveraging its strategic partner relationships, seemingly resigned to stagnant sales numbers and underperforming employees. Beyond that, the company’s approach to sales was entirely reactive rather than proactive, and almost all sales came from the owner and a few consultants.
The Solution
Intelligence IT’s leaders realized they needed to build a foundational model of their own sales team, rather than ask outside consultants and the owner to do more. They needed to control their own destiny by hiring their own sales team and directing their efforts.
Recognizing they didn’t have the expertise to build a sales team from scratch, Intelligence IT’s leaders understood they needed to hire a sales professional with meaningful leadership experience. Unable to afford a full-time sales leader because of the investment they needed to make in hiring three new salespeople, they turned to the fractional sales leadership model. Immediately, the new fractional leader pivoted the team’s sales strategy to focus on software sales that drove their consultant engagement. He created new onboarding processes and forecasting models, built new compensation plans, hired three salespeople, and installed and customized a new HubSpot CRM for the team’s specific sales needs.
The Results
After hiring a fractional sales leader, Intelligence IT grew 50% in revenue in one year — and is on pace to grow 35% to 40% for each of the next three years. The company continues to grow its sales and dive deeper into its new proactive sales strategy.
These examples are proof that traditional leadership is by no means the only way. There has been a significant shift toward outsourcing leadership, especially for small businesses that need the experience of a sales leader who has led teams to success in similar circumstances. They need someone who can take charge of leading strategic growth and change — someone who has done it before in a past life and can apply that experience as a fractional executive in a new role.
These are the situations in which fractional sales leaders shine and make it possible for small businesses to shine, too.

     Just what is a Sales Strategy? More importantly, how can your company build an effective Sales Strategy to increase sales and boost market share? Let’s start with the basics by defining “Sales Strategy”:
Sales Strategy Definition
For top sales performance and results, your Sales Strategy should be…
…a well-defined, goal-focused, clearly communicated, and mission-oriented plan that positions your solutions (i.e., your products and services) uniquely in the minds of your targeted customers, while also providing actionable direction for your sales organization.
Key Elements of an Effective Sales Strategy
Let’s take a deeper dive into that definition to recognize and understand its most important components:
Well-defined
While many smaller organizations tend to operate with a “seat of the pants” approach, most sustainable, successful, and growing organizations understand the importance of defining and documenting their plans and processes. Your Sales Strategy must be clearly documented, containing key information like goals, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), buyer personas, sales processes, team structure, competitive analysis, product positioning, and specific selling methodologies.
Goal-focused
Your Sales Strategy should also include at least broad reference to measures of overall sales success and market leadership. While specific quotas and objectives are best detailed in sales plans and internal communication, your Sales Strategy should state, with intent, how your company plans to lead in the marketplace. As described above, your Sales Strategy should provide a detailed description of the important components of success.
Clearly Communicated
No matter how well-defined or goal-focused, your Sales Strategy will only succeed if clearly communicated to internal and external stakeholders. Clear communication, of course, demands understanding, so you’ll also need to monitor your Sales Strategy messaging to ensure what you intend to say is what your audience actually reads, hears, perceives, and believes. (And don’t forget that your audience isn’t just customers, but also your employees.)
A Mission-oriented Plan
Whereas a corporate Mission Statement is also big-picture and goal-oriented, your Sales Strategy should go further by adding how the mission will be accomplished. Think of your Sales Strategy as a bridge between your Mission Statement and your specific sales plans and processes.
A Unique Solution Positioning Statement
Positioning and differentiation are always essential to sales success. Therefore, your Sales Strategy should reference your unique place within the market and how you will differentiate your solution from your competitors. (Naturally, you’ll need to clearly understand your competitors and their methods and messaging.)
Target Customer Oriented
Likewise, sales success demands a clear understanding of your ideal customers and their needs and expectations. So, your Sales Strategy should refer to your buyer personas as well.
Actionable
Finally, a successful Sales Strategy must be actionable – that is, translatable into effective sales processes that turn plans into results. If the above elements are thoughtfully included in your Sales Strategy, it should be relatively easy to align your sales processes with it.
Creating Your Best Sales Strategy
To build an effective Sales Strategy, one designed to reach clients and close sales, you’ll need to recognize and respect your target market, your competitive differentiators and advantages, and the key resources in your organization.
Remember, however, that an effective Sales Strategy is not a one-and-done endeavor. As your market, customers, solutions, and processes change, so must your Sales Strategy. Revisit your Sales Strategy at least annually to make sure it accurately represents where your organization is and where it intends to go.

     The COVID-19 pandemic left no stone unturned when it came to disrupting industries around the world. Although the pandemic forced some businesses to shutter, it helped others evolve.
Economic disruption forced businesses to pivot — most had no choice if they wanted to stay above water amid a shutdown. The growth of digital sales accelerated at warp speed, accomplishing in six months what would have likely taken six years. Consumers are behaving and purchasing differently, both in business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies. As a result, businesses have adjusted their selling strategies to keep pace and prepare for a new era of sales.
The pandemic’s range of impacts — negative, positive, and everything between — has been vast. Some companies were deemed nonessential and had to cease operations; others benefited from increased demand for specific products and services. For example, Walmart reported nearly 9% in first quarter revenue growth due to increased demand for grocery pickup and delivery services. This situation’s unpredictable nature has put some small businesses in a holding pattern, waiting to quantify the pandemic’s total impact on their operations.
Challenges Faced by Small Business Owners
Whether businesses have been positively or negatively affected, most have been forced to adapt to changing consumer behavior in some way. New customers are waiting to make their first purchases, and returning customers are holding off on reordering.
This situation has paralyzed some companies in fear. They’re hoarding cash and hoping business will return to normal instead of focusing on how business may look different moving forward. This is a disservice to those businesses because everyone will have to learn how to sell differently in a completely changed environment.
On the other hand, future-focused businesses have used this time to reach out to their best customers to see how they are doing — and how they can help support them in a tough time. They have resisted the urge to draw inward and have communicated more with their customers. Most importantly, they’ve given thought to where their company fits into a future that may be vastly different than the one they knew before the pandemic.
How to Respond to a Crisis in Business
When the status quo changes, the “old rules” no longer apply. Old assumptions either need to be validated all over again or changed to fit the new reality. The leaders of small and midsize businesses and growth companies have enough to worry about without trying to get a handle on sales leadership.
In sales, for example, the old assumption was that you had to be face-to-face with a customer for them to buy. COVID-19 quickly proved that assumption to be incorrect. Smart businesses have considered how they need to respond differently to this unknown environment.
In this new world of digital sales, customers gain information through webinars, instructional videos, and online demos — not solely through a salesperson. If your company feels overwhelmed and behind on adapting to this new environment, it may be time to consider sales leadership alternatives. Developing a sales advisory board and finding mentorship opportunities can be great solutions from a strategic standpoint.
If you need tactical help, it may be time to consider hiring a sales consultant. These four questions can help you determine whether that might be the right choice for you:
1. ‘Do I have the sales experience to get our organization where it needs to be?’
As the owner of a business, you have not spent a career in sales leadership and likely have not navigated a crisis from a sales standpoint. A new era of sales requires someone with the experience and technical skills to figure out how to respond to a crisis in business. To help your business evolve with new standards, it’s important to be honest with yourself about your current skill set. Have you weathered sales crises before? Do you have what it takes to lead your team forward?
2. ‘Would I be better off focusing on my core competency?’
If you’re like most business owners, you expect yourself to be an expert at every departmental discipline. In reality, you might be better off focusing on your core competency. It’s more constructive to find someone to run sales who has that as a core competency, freeing you up to focus on what you do best.
3. ‘Do I have the time to be an exceptional sales leader?’
Being a sales leader in title only isn’t enough. You may have the interest and skills, but do you have the time to devote to being a great sales leader? You are called to lead the organization as well as every department. A successful sales leader must have the time for weekly pipeline review meetings with each sales rep and to travel with reps as needed. If that doesn’t fit into your schedule, you might consider hiring a sales consultant.
4. ‘Do I have the right sales infrastructure in place to maximize my sales team’s performance?’
As a business owner, the onus is on you to consider whether your company is set up correctly to get the results you seek. That includes having the right people in the right roles , a CRM customized to your workflows, and a compensation plan that appropriately incentivizes sellers while outlining appropriate KPIs and a defined sales process – essential in sales infrastructure consulting. You may have the time, desire, and skills to lead a sales team, but do you have the correct sales infrastructure in place to allow for growth?
The pandemic has changed the way the world works — especially how small businesses approach sales. In this new environment, customers are more accustomed to purchasing digitally, and your sales team must be able to pivot to keep up. As a leader, you need to do some soul searching to determine whether you have the time, talents, and resources to lead that charge — or if it makes more sense to outsource your sales leadership by hiring a sales consultant.

How to Unstick a Stalled Deal (Even if it Means No Deal at All)

The One-Two Punch for Consulting Success: Strategic Partnerships Plus Word-of-Mouth

How Consulting Can Help You Ease Into Retirement


    ","
     The COVID-19 pandemic left no stone unturned when it came to disrupting industries around the world. Although the pandemic forced some businesses to shutter, it helped others evolve.
Economic disruption forced businesses to pivot — most had no choice if they wanted to stay above water amid a shutdown. The growth of digital sales accelerated at warp speed, accomplishing in six months what would have likely taken six years. Consumers are behaving and purchasing differently, both in business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies. As a result, businesses have adjusted their selling strategies to keep pace and prepare for a new era of sales.
The pandemic’s range of impacts — negative, positive, and everything between — has been vast. Some companies were deemed nonessential and had to cease operations; others benefited from increased demand for specific products and services. For example, Walmart reported nearly 9% in first quarter revenue growth due to increased demand for grocery pickup and delivery services. This situation’s unpredictable nature has put some small businesses in a holding pattern, waiting to quantify the pandemic’s total impact on their operations.
Challenges Faced by Small Business Owners
Whether businesses have been positively or negatively affected, most have been forced to adapt to changing consumer behavior in some way. New customers are waiting to make their first purchases, and returning customers are holding off on reordering.
This situation has paralyzed some companies in fear. They’re hoarding cash and hoping business will return to normal instead of focusing on how business may look different moving forward. This is a disservice to those businesses because everyone will have to learn how to sell differently in a completely changed environment.
On the other hand, future-focused businesses have used this time to reach out to their best customers to see how they are doing — and how they can help support them in a tough time. They have resisted the urge to draw inward and have communicated more with their customers. Most importantly, they’ve given thought to where their company fits into a future that may be vastly different than the one they knew before the pandemic.
How to Respond to a Crisis in Business

     7 Critical Actions That Drive Sales Success
Careful planning is needed when companies combine through mergers or acquisitions.  The financial aspects of the merger get lots of attention, but sales force issues can be left unresolved.  In the long run, taking the proper steps to ensure that the new sales force operates effectively from day one could have the largest impact on future financial success. Key steps are:
 1 -Determine the New Sales Management Team 
In all probability, sales momentum has already been negatively impacted by the merger.  Prior to the completion of the merger, uncertainty abounds and rumors will sweep through both sales organizations.  Your top performers are vulnerable to competitive offers during this time.  Act fast to lock in your best talent.
Due diligence requires more than a financial review.  Evaluation of key sales personnel needs to be a critical component of your merger planning.  Management needs to move swiftly to get the new sales force in place.  Decisions regarding the sales leadership team need to be made in advance of the merger date and the new sales leadership should be in place and focused on the day the merger is finalized.
 2 – Establish Your Value Proposition and Make Sure Every Sales Person Knows It
Your sales team has to clearly understand your strategy and be able to effectively present it to your clients.  The combined organization has expanded capabilities and greater resources. You need to clearly define your message so that your customers and prospects understand how they can benefit from your new organization.  Test your message early in the transition and ask your clients for feedback – adjust your message as necessary.
 3 – Resolve Account Conflicts Before They Hurt Customers
Prior to the merger, if both companies provided similar products in the same markets, account conflicts within the combined sales force are bound to occur.  Successful resolution of these conflicts is one of the most important factors in keeping revenue growing, but it is also one of the most difficult to achieve.  Every large customer needs to be reviewed in an impartial manner.  A number of factors come into play:  where in the customer’s organization is each rep positioned; how much revenue does each rep produce from the account; how long have they been involved with the account; and what does the current sales pipeline look like for each rep?   Ultimately, account ownership should go to the rep who offers the best chance of maintaining and growing the customer relationship.
 4 – Evaluate Staffing Levels in Every Market 
Growth in the size of your sales force does not equate to an expansion of the market served by that group.  I learned this through experience.  My top management wanted fast revenue growth so they left all the reps in place following a merger.  We ended up overstaffed in many markets and sales results suffered as territories had to be reduced to accommodate the larger number of reps.  With fewer prospects, sales results slipped, profitability declined, forecasts were missed and turnover increased.  Performance didn’t get back into balance until the combined number of reps was brought in line with market potential.
 5 – Set Sales Territories Quickly
When sales territories are not clearly defined for each sales person, sales productivity will suffer.  Reps will chase the wrong type of accounts or compete with each other for the same business.  Inexperienced sales people will go after complex accounts with no chance of success but a high likelihood of damaging your reputation.  High potential prospects will be ignored while sales people chase home runs with little probability of success.  Territories can be list based, segmented by prospect size or industry, geographically based, or developed based on any number of other factors.  There is no perfect formula.  The key is to have territories that are clearly defined and properly sized.
 6 – Integrate Comp Plans ASAP
As a matter of practice, sales activity will be determined by the comp plan and not by management’s wishes and strategy.  If the pre-merger plans are left in place, sales reps will focus on any perceived unfairness between the plans – especially if it can be demonstrated that one plan pays more than the other for a similar sale.  A smart sales rep will look at the comp plan and figure out the best way to maximize his or her income.  If you need to drive new customer acquisition, your comp plan better not direct reps toward customer retention.   If you plan to foster the desired sales results, address the problem immediately.   The answer is to create a plan which drives the sales force toward the revenue goals of the company and apply the unified plan to the entire sales organization as quickly as possible.
 7 – Review the New Order Flow and Make Sure It Works
It may seem obvious, but mergers often disrupt systems and processes.  In a merger I was involved with, the acquiring organization was surprised shortly after the merger when they realized that one of the products offered by the acquired company required a sales engineering review.  Unfortunately, because of a lack of understanding of this process, all of the sales engineers were eliminated during the reorganization.  The backlog expanded and customer service deteriorated.  Orders were cancelled and revenue was delayed until alternative plans could be put in place.  The problem was avoidable, but no one had walked through the order flow prior to making the organizational changes.
At Sales Xceleration, we know that many organizations suffer needlessly from a merger or acquisition, often because they neglect key sales management and leadership fundamentals. While mergers and acquisitions have an impact on every part of a business, the changes to the sales organization should be a priority.

https://salesxceleration.com/answer-your-customers-three-whys-to-ensure-your-sales-process-is-perfectly-aligned/,"
     In every sale – no matter the product, service, market, or vertical – the customer needs to answer three important questions. Why do anything? Why you? Why now? Understanding your customer’s “Three Whys” will help you design a sales process that is in perfect alignment with the way your customer wants to buy.
Why do anything? Confirming the Business Necessity
The first question a customer needs to answer involves the business necessity of doing anything at all. Do I really have a problem and what will the payoff be if we spend the time and resources required to fix it? This is what your customer will ask themselves when deciding whether they need to take action.
To create alignment, the early stages of your sales process should focus on showing them you are a knowledgeable and credible resource who can help them think through the nature of the problem.
This is the time to identify and connect with the individual person who owns the responsibility of fixing the problem within the customer organization. Deep discovery will reveal the nature of the issue they are facing, how they have already tried to fix it, and what the ideal situation would look like if the problem was solved. Uncovering specific metrics that are being affected will help quantify the impact of the issue on the business. You will exit this stage when your customer is confident that something needs to be done about the problem and when you have helped them create a list of features and functions a solution to the problem must have.
Why you?  Choosing Who to Work With and What Solution to Buy
Next, they need to decide what to buy and from whom to buy it. They will likely shop you and your competition to compare options. Answering the “Why you” question is no small thing for the customer. The recommendations and decisions they make represent risk to the organization and risk to them personally if they turn out to be wrong.
During this stage, it will be important for you to build the trust that will be required for them to believe you and your company are who they want to work with. This is the time to focus on presenting the value of your solution. You need to show how you meet or exceed their criteria. You will want to actively uncover and overcome any possible objections, and show your customer what makes you different than your competition. Anchor their trust by presenting proof that you have delivered measurable results for previous customers.
You will know you have won their confidence and it is time to move to the final stages when your customer asks you to turn your proposal into a contract.
Why now? Quantifying Urgency
It is not uncommon for you to lose a deal at this point in the sales cycle not because you were outsold by the competition, but because the customer decides to do nothing.
Research by CEB revealed that almost half of all B2B sales pursuits end with no decision by the customer. The biggest reason for this is an inability within the customer organization to agree that there is urgency and priority to spend the money, time, and resources that will be required if they say yes to your deal.
Being successful at this stage relies heavily upon the work you have done to this point. Value wins, and the best value can always be tied to achieving key business results. Growing revenue, lowering cost, expanding market share, and servicing customers better will always be urgent issues within every business. Don’t leave the value of your solution to the imagination. Quantify and communicate it early and often. Make it emphatic to ensure your customer has strong reasons to move forward, especially near final decision time when they are answering the “Why now” question.
From here, it’s a matter of managing the closing and contracting process. The best sales reps create a close plan to document everything that needs to be done, to identify a deadline date for each activity, and to assign a responsible person for each item on the checklist. All that remains is to diligently work the plan until the final signature is collected.
Putting it all Together
Examine your current sales process and how closely it aligns to your customer’s need to answer the “Three Whys.” If it fails to match up, make the proper adjustments with the help of our outsourced sales solutions, train your sales team on the changes, and move forward with the confidence that you and your customer will be buying and selling perfectly in sync.

     Every four years the calendar provides the gift of an extra day. Call it Leap Day. But what if every day had the potential to feel like a gift? It can. Any day in any year can be a gift like Leap Day if it means you are taking a leap of faith by putting yourself on the path toward a brighter future. For many seasoned sales executives and sales leaders, that path leads to sales management consulting. And their leap of faith is really just a transition to their next chapter of professional fulfillment.
Keep this in mind as you consider the gift of Leap Day (and every day): taking a leap of faith requires just two things of you:

Having faith – in yourself, your purpose, and your value to others
Taking that leap (more of a single step, actually) to make your second-act professional dreams come true

The Faith Part
Faith in Yourself
Taking a leap of professional faith begins on a personal note – having faith in yourself. And why not? After all, you’ve accomplished so much, both professionally and personally. You’ve gained valuable skills, honed your craft and earned the respect of your peers as a career sales leader. You’ve helped your employer grow and succeed and make a difference in the world. You’ve overcome obstacles, risen to meet challenges, and perhaps achieved more than you thought you could. And along the way, you’ve been a vital contributor to your family and your community, perhaps even to your church. (Yes, it’s possible – important, even – to have faith in your faith!)
Faith in Your Purpose
Having faith in yourself becomes easier when you focus on accomplishments, not shortcomings; on blessings, not frustrations. Doing that also makes it easier to recognize and have faith in your passion and your purpose. If you know where to find them, that is.
Many career sales professionals considering their post-corporate lives ask, “What’s next?” That’s a good and natural place to start. Unfortunately, too often they believe their next professional chapter must be radically different from their first. For many, this might be true. If you have a passion for fishing and yearn to be a fishing guide or make custom lures, that’s great. Congratulations on having a specific vision for your future! If you have always been a great storyteller and want to get to work on that novel, go for it. The world is waiting. But if you find yourself searching for “what’s next” and every possibility also seems like a dead end, consider instead looking closer to home. Look to your expertise and experience in sales leadership. You might just find your purpose lies in doing what you’ve been doing all this time – just in a different way and serving a new set of professional partners.
Faith in Your Value to Others
Serving others begins with recognizing how much they value what you can provide them. If you could see through their eyes the respect they have for your skills, your insights, your wisdom, and your leadership, you would quickly see the difference you can make. I’m talking about smaller companies – small to mid-sized businesses – that crave the guidance of a seasoned sales management professional like you. They want and need to take advantage of all you’ve learned, applied and accomplished at the large corporate level – just on a smaller scale, and typically for less time each week. This is called fractional sales management consulting. It’s called being an Outsourced VP of Sales. It’s called serving and leading and making a difference.
The Leap Part
Finding faith in yourself, your purpose, and your value to others should make “the leap part” easy, right? In theory, yes. But it is human nature to be cautious, to look before you leap. Just don’t get caught up in “paralysis by analysis.” As Steve Harvey said in his famous online video and his book, Jump: Take the Leap of Faith to Achieve Your Life of Abundance, “Every successful person in this world has jumped.” It’s “the only way to get to that abundant life. You got to jump, man. You got to take a chance.”
The Bottom Line:
Whether you call it a jump or a leap of faith, your future begins with being open to opportunity. And taking advantage of that opportunity can be as simple as using your past to help shape your future. I strongly believe there are many amazing possibilities for sales leaders who explore the option of becoming a sales management consultant.

     Every four years the calendar provides the gift of an extra day. Call it Leap Day. But what if every day had the potential to feel like a gift? It can. Any day in any year can be a gift like Leap Day if it means you are taking a leap of faith by putting yourself on the path toward a brighter future.

https://salesxceleration.com/sales-grinding-to-a-halt-align-your-sales-strategies-and-selling-methods/,"
     Developing a sales strategy is one of the keys to success in sales. Notice – “one of” the keys. There are, of course, many essential components – including your sales vision and mission, sales processes, sales forecasting, tracking and analytics, to name a few. With so many moving parts, your sales operation is like a set of gears with interlocking cogs that must mesh precisely to make the entire machine turn in unison.
Two such gears in continual contact and motion with one another are your sales strategy and your selling methods. If these cogs are out of alignment, your entire sales apparatus will grind to a halt.
Sales Strategy Definition
As noted in a previous blog found here, your sales strategy should be a “well-defined, goal-focused, clearly communicated, and mission-oriented plan that positions your solutions (i.e., your products and services) uniquely in the minds of your targeted customers while also providing actionable direction for your sales organization.”
“Actionable direction” is where your selling methods help your strategies come to life, where ideas become solutions, and through which your prospects can become your customers.
Essential Parts of Any Successful Selling Method
There are countless methods of selling, some relatively simple and straightforward, others trendy and unorthodox. But any method used, to be effective, must:

Be targeted. An effective sales method must address the particular needs and characteristics of a high-quality prospect and the competitive market in which they operate.
Solve a problem or fill a need. The sales method must focus on solving the customer’s pain. If the solution is not a good fit, it’s not really a solution at all.
Be flexible and responsive. An effective sales method is easily adaptable, in sync with the prospect’s status in the sales funnel. While initial customer targeting might be data-driven per your CRM, the selling method used must readily adapt to the customer’s real-time needs and not get bogged down in an overly rigid process.

Types of Selling Methods
With these prerequisites established, what are some popular methodologies to choose from? Recently developed selling methods tend to use acronyms in their names. These include SPIN and SNAP and BANT and ANUM and N.E.A.T. and MEDDIC, for example. Each has its unique aspects and applications, but for now, let’s consider some of the more traditional and time-proven selling methods:
Solution-Based Selling
Solution-based selling focuses on benefits to the customer first, followed by emphasizing the features of the solution. With a solution-based selling method, it becomes easier to address the prospect’s “pain” and differentiate your company’s products or services from those offered by your competitors.
Value-based Selling
Value-based selling is related to solution-based selling in that it focuses on the value of benefits. This makes price less relevant and also makes it easier to overcome objections, close the sale, and create win-win situations for the customer and the seller.
Inbound Selling
Inbound selling responds to prospect inquiries based on successful marketing and lead-generation. Sometimes, this is an online process, with the prospect responding to a web-based or social media marketing campaign. With inbound selling, the prospect is pre-qualified by indicating at least a baseline level of interest in the seller’s solution. Depending on the nature of the product or service being offered, other selling methods can be adopted to turn the lead into a customer.
Traditional (Persuasive) Selling
Persuasive Selling is the classic (“old school,” perhaps) style of selling. While all sales methods can require some amount of persuasion, this methodology is often high-pressure. Because of that, it tends to be best for one-off sales opportunities and is not recommended for building trust-based, long-term relationships.
Collaborative Selling
At the opposite end of the spectrum from persuasive selling is Collaborative Selling. This non-manipulative method is low-pressure by nature. It emphasizes empathy and understanding and relationship-building; thus, it takes longer to close the deal. Because of this, a more aggressive competitor could enter the picture and capture the sale. Nonetheless, for prospects who resist pressure, building trust through collaborative selling could be the right approach.
Consultative Selling
Consultative selling is based on building a professional relationship in which problem-solving solutions are provided over an extended period. The salesperson using this method is often the same as the solution provider, serving as a consultant (such as Sales Xceleration’s sales leadership consultants, for example).
Aligning Your Sales Strategies and Selling Methods
Aligning your big-picture sales strategies with your tactical selling methods takes thought and some analysis, but it’s not all that complicated. In fact, you can simply make lists of each – strategies in Column A and selling methods in Column B – and draw connecting lines between the matches. It can really be that simple to identify how the two critical elements relate.
Perhaps most important, a visual exercise like this will clearly indicate where connections are missing. If you have a strategy that is not supported by any selling methodology – or a sales method that doesn’t dovetail with any strategy – this should raise a red flag: Is your strategy not actionable? Or are your sales processes not “walking the talk” of your strategic direction? In either case, the lack of a clear connection highlights an area to be fine-tuned so your sales strategies and selling methods are in alignment across the board.
The Bottom Line:
Admittedly, this is a high-level overview of just some of the selling methods that can be used to make your sales strategy successful. Alignment is essential. Your selling methods must support and reinforce your overall sales strategy which, in turn, must support and reinforce your company’s solutions and overall brand.
Developing a sales strategy and aligning your selling methods with it can be among your most important keys to success in sales.

     Regardless of the time of year, it’s always good to focus on positives and reflect on your blessings. If you’re like me and have enjoyed a long career in sales leadership, you’ve got much to be thankful for. But even if you are at a point in your professional life where you are beginning to ask what’s next, I’ve got good news for you: it’s possible – essential, even – to turn an attitude of gratitude into new altitude – reaching even higher heights – in your next professional chapter. Better yet, you can “turn thanks into giving” as you build on your blessings and work with a profound sense of purpose to give back to business owners who crave your expertise. Here’s what I mean:
Experience (and Experiences) to be Thankful For
In your extensive career as a sales leader, you’ve amassed more than just a wealth of knowledge, more than just a toolbox of expertise, and more than just a multi-decade track record. You’ve enjoyed not just experience, but also experiences. I’m talking about the kinds of character-building moments and situations that created opportunities to grow and learn and serve. It was in these moments your problem-solving mettle was tested and your professional value was forged. You’ve taken on challenges and exceeded goals and expectations. You’ve found your voice, found your vision, found your calling. Sure, you’ve fallen short at times, but you also managed to learn from those situations and apply that learning to future successes.
Through it all – the meetings, the frustrations, the travel, the time away from home, the difficult customers and difficult bosses – you carried on and held your head high while somehow still keeping your nose to the grindstone.
In other words, you’ve built a sales leadership career to be proud of. But because of the way you’ve led your professional life, I have a feeling you also have the perspective necessary to look back with an attitude of gratitude. To find the blessings in your long career. But also, to want more – because you have more to give.
Giving Back by Moving Forward
After a long corporate career, many successful sales leaders seek a new kind of success in their next chapter, in their second half. They seek a way to build on their professional foundations and continue working – this time with a greater sense of purpose and using their passion to make a difference – but outside the corporate grind.
And certainly, many sales leaders have found a way to do just that. They’ve discovered how to turn their wealth of knowledge, their toolbox of expertise, their deep experience, and their character-building experiences, into a new opportunity. An opportunity to use what they’ve learned and build on their past success as they work with passion and purpose. And make a difference.
What so many sales leaders have discovered, you see, is that there is a huge market of small to mid-sized businesses who struggle every day to reach their sales and revenue targets. These businesses struggle to expand their pipelines or turn prospects into customers. They struggle, even, to put effective sales management, strategies, and processes in place, let alone manage these strategies and processes.
That’s where you come in. By becoming a sales leadership consultant, you can serve these businesses. By working on a fractional time basis as an outsourced VP of Sales, you can put them on the path to record growth. By leveraging your corporate success and the years of experience (and experiences), you can turn thanks into giving as you work with purpose to give back to business owners who crave your expertise, find value in your wisdom, and are willing to pay well for it.
And that’s certainly something to be thankful for.

For others, however, reaching the level of VP of Sales eventually seems like a hollow achievement. Why? Because many of us reach a point where we want to work with a sense of purpose and the knowledge that we are making a more significant difference within the organizations we serve. With a fast-growing network of sales leadership consultants nationwide and in international markets, we’ve seen how that purpose-filled professional dream can come true. All it takes are five fundamentals. Do you have these five essentials for success as a sales leadership consultant?
Sales Leadership Consulting Fundamental #1: Passion
Sometimes an early passion for a career such as sales can be swallowed up in the corporate world simply as a matter of scale. Those early victories that felt so glorious and so important get lost as contributions are no longer valued as they were in the past. We yearn simply to be recognized – to have our hard work and results appreciated, to be listened to and to be valued. But what so many Sales Xceleration Advisors – our sales leadership consultants – tell us is that the passion is still there, a small flame that still burns but needs kindled with new challenges and opportunities. Opportunities to serve small to mid-sized businesses. Opportunities to work with a sense of purpose. Opportunities to find fulfillment by helping business owners attain new levels of sales success.
Sales Leadership Consulting Fundamental #2: Vision
Making your post-corporate professional dreams come true takes vision, too. First, it takes the vision to imagine a next chapter in your professional life. Next, it takes seeing possibilities for your second half story. Finally, it takes recognizing that you don’t have to leave your experience and expertise behind as you forge this new path. Quite the contrary: you can use the skill set you’ve worked hard to develop in ways that serve others in the smaller business community. 
If you look closely enough, you’ll see the strong market need for outsourced sales leadership consultants serving as fractional VPs of Sales. And once you see the need, it should be easy to see yourself filling that void. 
Sales Leadership Consulting Fundamental #3: Conviction
Henry David Thoreau wrote: “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you’ve imagined.” In other words, don’t just settle for finding your passion and sharpening your vision for the future; go there with conviction. Have faith not just in the dream but in yourself. Dedicate yourself to making that dream come true. With your background, skills, passion and vision, conviction should come easily. 
Before you look forward, however, take a brief look back at all you’ve accomplished. Channel the justifiable pride in your accomplishments into a sense of purpose and dedication. After all, you achieved so much to this point; just imagine how far you can go now that you have amassed a career’s worth of knowledge and practical wisdom!
Sales Leadership Consulting Fundamental #4: Collaboration
Success takes teamwork. It takes cooperation and support. One of the things our Sales Xceleration Advisors are so grateful for is the spirit of collaboration from other Advisors and from the Sales Xceleration team. That support goes beyond rah-rah speeches and pats on the back, of course. At Sales Xceleration, we arm our sales leadership consultants with suites of tools and information that make doing business simpler, easier, and more of a sure thing. No need to reinvent the wheel when you access all Sales Xceleration brings to the table. Just plug in your unique experience, expertise, and knowledge as you apply it all to serving clients and solving their sales management needs. 
Sales Leadership Consulting Fundamental #5: Permission
Finally, your post-corporate career dreams are within reach if – and only if – you give yourself permission to pursue them. By taking a chance on yourself and having faith in your ability to help others, you can turn your passion and vision and conviction and collaboration into a bright new reality.

    ",results-driven sales leadership training programs,results-driven,replace_existing_phrase,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/building-a-modern-sales-operating-system/,"
     Small to mid-sized businesses that want to remain competitive, regain market share, or establish sustainable sales growth strategy must keep pace with modern sales operations strategies, processes, tools, technologies, and other resources. To manage this, it helps to consider sales operations as a system: a Sales Operating System, or SOS.
How can your sales organization begin the journey toward a growth-oriented SOS? Consider these FAQs about building a Sales Operating System:
What is the Difference Between Sales Operations and a Sales Operating System?
Sales Operations is a strategic company function or functional unit. Why is Sales Operations important? What exactly does Sales Operations do? Well, Sales Operations is critical because it drives sales strategy, programs and processes, and goal attainment. It utilizes the tools, resources, analytics, and processes to identify, measure, and achieve KPIs for sales operations.
A Sales Operating System on the other hand helps Sales Operations, well, operate!
What Is a Sales Operating System?
A Sales Operating System (or SOS) is the set of systems, processes, and strategies that enables a company to build and manage an effective and profitable sales organization. It is the framework that empowers a company to scale Sales Operations for sustainable revenue and growth.

Why is a Sales Operating System Important?
A Sales Operating System provides the structure needed to deploy, execute, and manage essentials for sustainable sales growth and success. These include sales operation strategies, processes, technology, tools, resources, leadership, and frontline talent. It also provides the analytics needed to support timely and wise decision-making.
How does an SOS benefit the organization? Big-picture benefits include these and many more:

Improved sales forecasting
Increased sales productivity
Better decision making at all levels from strategy to process to customer engagement and conversion
Reduced cost of sales and better ROI on sales initiatives
Improved strategic alignment between company goals and effective sales objectives
Increased customer satisfaction (which can result in more efficient selling to repeat buyers)
Enhanced process and results tracking to identify areas for improvement

What Questions Are Essential to Answer When Building a Modern Sales Operating System?
To begin building a successful modern Sales Operating System, it is critical to know the right questions to ask, answer, and act on. Here are a few high-level questions, but of course there will be many others to consider as your SOS comes together:

What leadership, management, and frontline sales personnel are appropriate to run the sales organization? How do we most effectively attract, retain, motivate, and compensate them?
What tools, technologies, and resources will we need to help the sales team efficiently and effectively optimize outcomes?
Regarding sales analytics, how should the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system be designed and maintained for optimal control, effectiveness, usability, forecasting, and decision-making?
What policies and procedures need to be developed, implemented, and followed to help ensure smooth operations of the sales unit?
How can we design, manage, and maintain sales compensation programs that are market competitive? How can we regularly benchmark these programs to ensure continuing market competitiveness?
What sales compensation metrics (including individual and team quotas) should we establish, monitor, and manage to motivate and reward sales talent?

What is the Next Step to Start Building a Sales Operating System?
There is much to consider when establishing or refining your Sales Operating System. Knowing what an effective SOS entails and knowing great questions to ask can give you a leg up when it is time to navigate the path toward a better SOS. An additional resource to help you understand areas for change is the 10-question Sales Xceleration Sales Agility Assessment. This free tool can establish a baseline where operational areas are scored so subsequent changes can be measured.
Of course, trying to analyze, define, design, deploy, and manage those changes can be difficult for internal sales leaders to accomplish while also managing day-to-day Sales Operations. For many small to mid-sized businesses, therefore, it pays to engage an external resource such as a Sales Xceleration Advisor. Our sales leadership consultants typically work on a fractional time basis, leveraging decades of experience and expertise while providing the proper perspective needed to maximize sales organization performance. Once the Sales Operating System is enhanced and deployed, internal leadership usually resumes sales management utilizing the new and improved system.

Five Things Top Sales Leaders Do Differently

    ",proven sales leadership training,proven,insert_contextual_clause,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/one-less-hat-to-wear-how-business-owners-can-achieve-more-growth-and-success/,"
     In the world of small and medium-sized businesses, the business owner is a rare breed. Typically, the business began as a vision springing forth from the owner’s fertile and entrepreneurial mind. In many cases, that vision was for a product or service that offered a unique and much needed solution in the industry. The owner probably did the initial selling and succeeded in getting others to buy into the vision, and to purchase the product or engage the service. But success changes a business. It creates opportunities, certainly, but also problems. And the traits that served the business owner well in the beginning may begin to hold the business back from achieving sustained success. That’s where you can come in.
Too Many Hats
Growth – especially sustained growth – requires management. But the entrepreneurial owner, whose strength is often in providing a product/service-based vision for the company, may not be as adept at wearing all necessary “hats” for continued business success: leader, financial overseer, frontline sales performer, Sales Manager, etc. In fact, shifting focus to these areas – without the skill set to back it up – not only stifles the owner’s innate talents, but also leads to ineffective management and stalled company performance.
The sooner the owner recognizes his or her limitations – both in skill and time – and hands off one of the many hats (such as the hat for managing and executing sales strategies and processes), the sooner the company can start growing again.
The Vision Thing
The visionary owner is typically market savvy and has insights into the bigger picture that can lead to new and exciting products and services for an eager marketplace. But when it comes to managing people and processes to maximize sales efficiency and performance, a more inward focus and skill set are required. The visionary owner who prefers to look at the bigger market picture gets glassy-eyed when asked to establish a sales team, equip that team with the tools necessary to succeed, and then manage them toward the attainment of sales goals and quotas. And the business owner who feels uncomfortable with those day-to-day mechanics of running the sales force will most likely neglect them. The result? Sales plummet, the success of the company teeters on the brink, and the livelihoods of employees and their families hang in the balance.
Enter the Outsourced VP of Sales
What we’ve found at Sales Xceleration, through our years of providing management-level service and support to owners of small and medium-sized businesses, is that owners typically arrive at the point where they DO recognize the dangers associated with business growth. What’s more, when they arrive at a critical point in their company’s growth they usually welcome someone who is skilled at managing the sales function. The only problem is that they often don’t know where to look for, or how to integrate, an outside resource who can boost sales and manage both the sales team and sales process. They believe, since their business is still growing – and experiencing the growing pains – that they can’t afford a full-time VP of Sales. In many cases this is true. But at Sales Xceleration, we’ve found that these businesses can afford, and desperately need, a part-time Outsourced VP of Sales. And just like the entrepreneurial business owner who saw a need in a viable marketplace and filled that need, that’s what we’ve done with the proven systems of Sales Xceleration. Our growing team of licensed Sales Xceleration Advisors uses these systems to help these business owners and their businesses not only survive, but achieve new levels of success.
As an Outsourced VP of Sales, your skills and experience in sales leadership and sales management can help the business owner remove one of the hats that weighs him down and keeps the company from capitalizing on new opportunities. You can help the business bring the necessary elements of sales strategy, sales process, and sales management into focus, and put them into motion. You can be the driver to help the business target key prospects and strategically enter new markets. Then, you can help them define, implement and manage the best sustainable sales processes. You can help them put the right sales tools in the hands of the best team of salespeople. You can help the company forecast and measure its sales growth so the owner can make critical forward-looking business decisions. And perhaps most importantly, you can be the Sales Manager who motivates, trains, and coaches sales team members so they can personally succeed and become a key factor in the success of the company.
Bottom Line:
Many owners of small and medium-sized businesses hit a success ceiling, a problem typically rooted in neglecting the sales infrastructure required for sustained growth. They initially saw a need and found a way to meet that need. And when they started, their business, they had both vision and entrepreneurial spirit working in their favor. But few entrepreneurs are also superior managers for the long haul. Nevertheless, these business owners often still have the kind of visionary insight that enables them to recognize the need for help in achieving and managing sustained growth. In other words, what we have discovered at Sales Xceleration is not only that a lucrative marketplace exists, but also that the business owners in that marketplace are hungry for the kind of proven sales management services and systems available from Sales Xceleration and our licensed Advisors.
If you would like to learn more about Sales Xceleration and our sales leadership and consulting systems, we’d be delighted to discuss them with you.  Reach out to an Advisor today, or contact us at 1 (844) 874-7253.

    ",results-driven sales leadership training programs,results-driven,replace_existing_phrase,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/six-surprising-reasons-businesses-connect-with-a-sales-leadership-consultant/,"
     It’s no surprise that businesses need sales to survive and thrive. It’s no surprise that excellent sales leadership can be crucial to sales success. And it’s no surprise that many small to mid-sized companies struggle to afford full-time sales leadership talent when they need it. What might be surprising, however, are some of the reasons that cause business owners to finally seek and engage the services of a fractional-time sales leadership consultant.
Here are the 6 top reasons they take this essential step toward business growth:
Sales Are Stagnant or Declining
Sales, of course, are the lifeblood of business revenue and profitability. While it’s not unusual for sales to rise or fall from month to month, quarter to quarter, or year over year, savvy business owners track sales results and can spot alarming trends. Most often, results are viewed based on lagging indicators; that is, after the fact. Proactive business owners, however, focus more on leading indicators, given they can spot potential signs of trouble by looking at sales pipelines, movement within sales processes, etc. Regardless of how sluggish results are discovered, wise business owners engage the services of a sales leadership consultant before a downward sales trend becomes an inevitable catastrophic business failure. Partnering with a proven sales management consultant can be the decisive factor in reversing this decline.
Current Revenues Rely on Too Few Customers
It’s easy to get complacent and become comfortable with the status quo. For many businesses, it’s common to put too many eggs in too few baskets – in other words, putting their revenue at risk by having too much revenue generated by too few  customers. Obviously, when one or more of these primary customers moves on, a large percentage of overall revenue can be lost. Too often, this vulnerability only becomes apparent after a key customer exits. In any event, the smart business owner recognizes the best first step toward reducing this revenue risk: bringing in a sales leadership consultant who can generate a broader customer base.
The Owner Lacks Insight into Their Sales Operation
Many business owners are “hands off” when it comes to sales. This can be a good thing for the sales team and sales management who often want the autonomy to run their own business. However, when sales begin to slide, some business owners realize they really don’t understand their sales operations well enough. For example, they might not understand the processes involved to execute the sales strategy; or they might not have a firm grasp on sales performance trends or the tactics being taken to address declining sales. While the owner could make a more concerted and time-consuming effort to understand the internal operation, the better choice is often to bring in a sales leadership consultant who can analyze, provide critical perspective, and report back to the business owner. This more objective approach can lead to better decision making regarding necessary sales management changes.
The Owner Wants to Grow the Business, but…
…sales results are moving in the wrong direction because they don’t really understand the sales operation and probably don’t have the right sales team or infrastructure in place. Often such realizations come only after several quarters of declining sales and some businesslike soul searching. Unfortunately, recognizing the root problem is only the first step. The perspective of an outsider who can build the key infrastructure components necessary to build a superior sales team – from a VP of Sales to a Sales Manager to frontline sales reps – is essential to sustainable sales success. The sales leadership consultant can provide that perspective . . . and experience.
The Owner Wants to Sell the Business but…
…the business is overly dependent on the owner. When businesses begin, they are often bootstraps that depend on heavy involvement in all aspects by the founder. As the business grows, reins are sometimes relaxed, but often not enough. Because the owner has an emotional investment in the existence, operation, and growth of the business, he or she may feel obligated to be involved – deeply involved – in its day-to-day operations. This makes it seemingly impossible to sell the business because the owner IS the business. A sales leadership consultant, just like a sales strategy consultant,  can help realign responsibilities and design succession planning so a buyer can feel comfortable the business can thrive without the owner’s direct involvement.
The Owner Recognizes the Need for External Perspective
Even if all these factors aren’t clearly in focus for the business owner, the owner might simply have a moment of critical realization that change is needed. Call it a “light bulb moment,” when the owner realizes he or she is too deeply immersed in running the business to have the proper perspective about the business. Whether it’s a pure epiphany or a triggering event, it’s a pivotal moment that leads the owner to ask for help. Outside help. Help from an expert with a track record of success and the big-picture perspective necessary to make strategic and tactical changes. This expert is the sales leadership consultant.
The Bottom Line:
Businesses evolve. What once worked – organizationally and operationally – to create years of success, may simply no longer be effective. Perceptive business owners might recognize warning signs from various points of view.

Hope Realized Shows How Sales Management Consultants Help Business Owners

Becoming a Senior Entrepreneur: What Do You Have to Gain?


    ","
     It’s no surprise that businesses need sales to survive and thrive. It’s no surprise that excellent sales leadership can be crucial to sales success. And it’s no surprise that many small to mid-sized companies struggle to afford full-time sales leadership talent when they need it. What might be surprising, however, are some of the reasons that cause business owners to finally seek and engage the services of a fractional-time sales leadership consultant.
Here are the 6 top reasons they take this essential step toward business growth:
Sales Are Stagnant or Declining
Sales, of course, are the lifeblood of business revenue and profitability. While it’s not unusual for sales to rise or fall from month to month, quarter to quarter, or year over year, savvy business owners track sales results and can spot alarming trends. Most often, results are viewed based on lagging indicators; that is, after the fact. Proactive business owners, however, focus more on leading indicators, given they can spot potential signs of trouble by looking at sales pipelines, movement within sales processes, etc. Regardless of how sluggish results are discovered, wise business owners engage the services of a sales leadership consultant before a downward sales trend becomes an inevitable catastrophic business failure. Partnering with a proven sales management consultant can be the decisive factor in reversing this decline.
Current Revenues Rely on Too Few Customers
It’s easy to get complacent and become comfortable with the status quo. For many businesses, it’s common to put too many eggs in too few baskets – in other words, putting their revenue at risk by having too much revenue generated by too few  customers. Obviously, when one or more of these primary customers moves on, a large percentage of overall revenue can be lost. Too often, this vulnerability only becomes apparent after a key customer exits. In any event, the smart business owner recognizes the best first step toward reducing this revenue risk: bringing in a sales leadership consultant who can generate a broader customer base.
The Owner Lacks Insight into Their Sales Operation
Many business owners are “hands off” when it comes to sales. This can be a good thing for the sales team and sales management who often want the autonomy to run their own business. However, when sales begin to slide, some business owners realize they really don’t understand their sales operations well enough. For example, they might not understand the processes involved to execute the sales strategy; or they might not have a firm grasp on sales performance trends or the tactics being taken to address declining sales. While the owner could make a more concerted and time-consuming effort to understand the internal operation, the better choice is often to bring in a sales leadership consultant who can analyze, provide critical perspective, and report back to the business owner. This more objective approach can lead to better decision making regarding necessary sales management changes.
The Owner Wants to Grow the Business, but…
…sales results are moving in the wrong direction because they don’t really understand the sales operation and probably don’t have the right sales team or infrastructure in place. Often such realizations come only after several quarters of declining sales and some businesslike soul searching. Unfortunately, recognizing the root problem is only the first step. The perspective of an outsider who can build the key infrastructure components necessary to build a superior sales team – from a VP of Sales to a Sales Manager to frontline sales reps – is essential to sustainable sales success. The sales leadership consultant can provide that perspective . . . and experience.
The Owner Wants to Sell the Business but…
…the business is overly dependent on the owner. When businesses begin, they are often bootstraps that depend on heavy involvement in all aspects by the founder. As the business grows, reins are sometimes relaxed, but often not enough. Because the owner has an emotional investment in the existence, operation, and growth of the business, he or she may feel obligated to be involved – deeply involved – in its day-to-day operations. This makes it seemingly impossible to sell the business because the owner IS the business. A <a href=""https://salesxceleration.com/sales-leadership-training/""><strong>sales leadership training</strong></a> consultant, just like a sales strategy consultant,  can help realign responsibilities and design succession planning so a buyer can feel comfortable the business can thrive without the owner’s direct involvement.
The Owner Recognizes the Need for External Perspective
Even if all these factors aren’t clearly in focus for the business owner, the owner might simply have a moment of critical realization that change is needed. Call it a “light bulb moment,” when the owner realizes he or she is too deeply immersed in running the business to have the proper perspective about the business. Whether it’s a pure epiphany or a triggering event, it’s a pivotal moment that leads the owner to ask for help. Outside help. Help from an expert with a track record of success and the big-picture perspective necessary to make strategic and tactical changes. This expert is the sales leadership consultant.
The Bottom Line:
Businesses evolve. What once worked – organizationally and operationally – to create years of success, may simply no longer be effective. Perceptive business owners might recognize warning signs from various points of view. But regardless of how they become aware of the need for changes, business owners and their current sales management professionals might not be best qualified to bring about the necessary changes.
For a growing number of businesses experiencing declining sales or faltering futures, the sales leadership consultant can be the linchpin to brighter days ahead.

     When labor shortages and supply chain interruptions become the norm, many business owners seem satisfied to tread water in hopes of merely maintaining market share. Few even dare to think about top-line revenue growth or, more importantly, boosting profits. But savvy business owners realize that when their competitors are in a holding pattern of complacency, the time is right to target market gains – despite labor and logistics challenges. Can it be done? Can your business grow during such difficult times? Let’s consider some key factors and ways to overcome these seemingly insurmountable difficulties.
Is the Pursuit of Higher Profits on Pause?
Smart business owners tend to agree that increasing profits is more important than growing top-line revenue. Thus, it’s natural to assume that CEOs and owners proactively and intentionally pursue strategies to maximize profitability at all times, right? And yet, based on my experience and recent conversations with CEOs and sales teams, I am not seeing many leaders implementing intentional sales activities or sales strategies that would increase profits in the current market conditions.
What’s causing business owners to hit the pause button instead of pushing for higher profits? Labor shortages and supply chain disruptions appear to be at the root of the stagnation. Indeed, several of my clients have encountered these challenges, and they are not alone. In fact, recent market data indicate that 73% of companies have positions to fill but find it difficult to recruit new employees. Meanwhile, the number of unfilled positions in some sectors have reached a 20-year high. Making matters worse, according to a recent Predictive Index report, 48% of employees have thought about changing careers within the past 12 months. Certainly, many workers have done just that, leaving jobs in record numbers. This massive exodus has been called the “Turnover Tsunami,” and it is certainly making waves in US and global job markets.
Meanwhile, many supply chains are faltering and even on the brink of collapse. “Supply uncertainties, disruptions, and inflationary forces are here for the foreseeable future,” according to a recent Bloomberg article; and the cost to ensure on-time delivery of a container from Asia to the US has increased ten-fold over the past two years. Because some companies cannot afford these higher rates, they can’t utilize warehouse space originally contracted, causing further delays, and impacting the supply chain even more.
Shifting Strategies
It’s a vicious cycle – so vicious that 70% of CEOs and business owners I’ve spoken with over the last few months say they are not concerned with increasing top-line revenue, but they are concerned with being able to deliver on existing orders and retaining current clients. With this shift to a short-term view, several of these leaders have asked their sales teams to slow down business acquisition activities and just focus on customer retention. When asked “Why are you not still aggressively pursuing both acquisition and retention?” the most common answer is “How can I handle new business if I can’t even deliver the existing demand?”
This perspective is understandable but short-sighted. The critical question business owners should ask is this: “What is my sales strategy for maximizing profitability AND retention during a supply chain disruption or labor shortage?” – a question that strategic sales consulting is designed to answer. By focusing only on retention, business leaders are missing the potentially significant growth opportunity lying dormant in the current market conditions. And without an executable strategy to maximize profitability, a loss of market share could be permanent.
What should your growth strategy take into account? Here are five essential considerations:

 Not all customers are created equal

If current demand is higher than your ability to supply your product or service, you risk losing a few customers. Most businesses do their best to please and retain all customers while minimizing the impact and managing the fallout; but in reality, their clients become increasingly agitated. As a result, customers are either jumping ship now, or plan to once the market recovers and they can find a reliable alternative. So, would you rather lose your most profitable customer or your least profitable customer? Are your sales team’s activities addressing the smart priorities? Perhaps not, as 78% of businesses do not prioritize clients or prospective clients. Simply put, not all customers are created equal, and your time and energy should reflect that fact. During a supply or labor shortage, your most profitable customers should be prioritized, and you might want to proactively lose your least favorite customers to protect the capacity to retain your most profitable customers. This type of loyalty will pay dividends later.

 Keep selling

Which favorite customer would you love to clone? How would it benefit to win another five or ten customers like them? So, why not aggressively pursue those “ideal clients” now? Their current supplier might be struggling to deliver the products/services they need. So, this can be a prime opportunity to have a conversation with them, share your unique value proposition, and understand what would be necessary to win their business. You will have the capacity to serve them if you proactively free up capacity by offboarding customers who are less profitable or loyal.

 Profit is king

The labor situation impacts almost every industry and results in increased costs of goods. Yet, most businesses hesitate to increase prices or pass the increase in cost to their customers; as a result, profit margins shrink. You might decide to increase prices as part of your annual price increase at the end of the year, but if the impact on profitability is significant mid-term, it’s wise to consider an out-of-cycle price increase.

 Develop/Update your Value Proposition

When businesses hesitate to increase prices, it is often because they are not able to articulate their value proposition. An effective value proposition will help your sales team change the conversation from price to cost and value. To maximize competitiveness and profitability, therefore, develop or update your value proposition and your unique differentiators. Validate these with cost-effective qualitative and quantitative research. For example, qualitative research can take the form of one-on-one conversations with a cross section of your customers, followed by quantitative research via a more formal customer survey.

 Implement

Based on these considerations, once you have updated your strategy, share it with your sales team. But remember, most people need to hear something seven times before they act on it. So, consider the following as part of your implementations plan:

Communicate: Share the information verbally with your team and follow it with a detailed reference document
Workshop the implementation: Ask sales team members to present back to one another how each item will be implemented for at least two of their accounts. This will help team members internalize the information and think through aspects you might not have considered. It will also give you the opportunity to provide feedback on anything that is misinterpreted.
Roleplay: The team may feel uncomfortable delivering the new strategic messaging to customers. But these customer conversations and delivery of the value proposition to prospects is key to your plan’s implementation. With that in mind, roleplaying becomes critical. Just as NFL players practice the same play several times, sales professionals should do the same. This will help them more comfortably fine-tune and deliver their message, while overcoming objections.

All businesses and their markets vary. However, don’t write off this approach because you foresee unique industry-specific challenges even in the midst of common labor and supply chain difficulties. Rather, be proactive. Adapt your approach and execute a responsive and strategic sales plan designed to increase revenue and profit now while positioning your business accelerated growth once supply chains and labor markets return to normal rhythms. If you need help developing and executing a new growth strategy, I would be honored to help you identify profitable opportunities.

https://salesxceleration.com/understanding-your-leadership-voice/,"
     A few weeks ago, I attended a Vistage seminar on Transformational Leadership led by Brett Pyle, author of Your Extraordinary Why. The focus was to recognize your Leadership Voice and how to help those around you find and identify their own voice.
The biggest takeaway from this talk was that each of us in a leadership position has a dominant voice, with defined strengths. So, what are these distinct leadership styles?

Intellectual – strategic, visionary, analytical
Physical– lead by example, a doer, tactical
Conscience– spiritual, values
Emotional– empathetic, passionate, caring

Think for a moment: what is your go-to leadership style? The question is a little confusing, certainly. As you reflect on yourself as a leader, you probably see aspects of all four of these voices in your style. However, each of us has one dominant voice. The more you can identify your leadership style, and recognize those around you, the better off you and your company will be.
During this seminar, we were asked to move to four separate quadrants of the room, which were identified by these four leadership voices. It took me, and others, a while to contemplate and identify our core voice. When we spoke with others in our group that have the same dominant style, we discussed the strengths we possess as well as the possible deficiencies and blind spots.
So, how can knowing your internal voice be important? How can it be a competitive advantage for you, your team, and your company? For one, it can be very helpful to have a leadership team of divergent voices. This can add tremendous balance and perspective. There are times when it can be extremely important to have an emotional leader who can be empathetic, or a physical leader to roll up their sleeves and gets the work done.
Secondly, knowing your definitive voice will give you the ability to flex and change when necessary. For example, if you are that physical leader, you would rather do it than delegate or explain it. However, your style may make you a terrific tactician but weak on strategy. Ensuring you also have a strategic intellectual leader to call on will make your team that much stronger.
For your co-leaders and emerging leaders around you, giving them space, support, and encouragement to find their voice and style can be very empowering. And that can lead to strategies and growth that haven’t even occurred to you. That is where transformation can truly take place.

     Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Well, who doesn’t, right? If you recall the classic TV quiz show, which has appeared off-and-on in many U.S. versions since 1999, one of its key features has been the “lifeline.” In many cases, a contestant’s lifeline involved getting help from someone else, via a “Phone a Friend” or “Ask the Expert” assist. Of course, a lifeline can also be a rescue device, like a rope thrown from a boat to someone who is adrift at sea.
Indeed, we all need a little help at times – whether it’s in the form of advice, guidance, or outright rescue – including in our professional lives when career tides shift and we feel rudderless, if not completely adrift.
But what if the professional lifeline you need in your sales leadership career can also help you BE the lifeline for others? What would that look like? Feel like? And how can you make it happen?
The Corporate Lifeline
Starting out in your corporate sales career, your early jobs might have seemed like lifelines; finally, you had a way to use what you were good at – selling – to make a better life for yourself and your family. With each accomplishment, your confidence grew. Maybe you stayed with that first company or maybe you moved up through the ranks by changing organizations; whatever the case, you gained experience, expertise, and a solid reputation for sales leadership. And whereas your corporate position once seemed like a lifeline to help you achieve your goals, suddenly it was a more equal partnership as you became a lifeline helping the company thrive, too.
But then what? At a certain point, the challenges that once drove and inspired you to excellence became mundane. You were still good at – actually, great at – your job, but more and more it felt like, well, just a job. Making matters worse was the fact that a new generation was climbing the corporate ladder while your career had plateaued.
The Lifeline You (and Others) Need is Yourself
With no new challenges and opportunities on the horizon, you probably began asking yourself, “What’s next? Am I stuck where I am? And if not, where do I go from here?” You’re not alone. Nearly all sales leadership professionals reach a point in their careers when they feel burned out, unchallenged, and undermotivated. They, like you, have wondered if there’s another path that offers reinvigoration and prosperity without throwing away everything they learned that got them where they are.
Meanwhile, owners of small and mid-size businesses are asking many of the same questions: “What’s next? Is the business stuck where it is – or going backwards? And if not, where does it go from here?”
Simply put, your yearnings for next-chapter success – and the experience and expertise you’ve gained during your corporate career – can be the lifeline that empowers you and the smaller business owner to reach your common goals. By leveraging your hard-earned sales leadership wisdom and record of accomplishments, you can take on the new and rewarding opportunity of becoming a sales leadership consultant. By acting as a fractional Outsourced VP of Sales for smaller organizations in your area, you can refuel your passion for sales, rediscover your purpose as a sales leader, and help struggling businesses re-ignite their prosperity with sustainable sales growth.
In other words, what you’ve learned and accomplished in your corporate career can be the lifeline to your next chapter of success and YOU can be the lifeline that empowers small and mid-size businesses to thrive again.
How can you make this happen? All it takes is one small step to get started. Contact Sales Xceleration today by clicking here or contacting us at 844.874.7253 to learn more about sales leadership consulting. Opportunities to meet the ever-expanding need are open in all markets. Consider this the lifeline you need to answer tough questions and clarify your choices as you navigate a rewarding future.

     In the ever-changing economic landscape, corporate America gets most of the attention. Big companies announce their earnings or losses and markets and the media react. But the fortunes of small- to medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, are often overlooked when judging the state of the economy. This is despite the fact that SMBs comprise more than 54% of U.S. sales and account for 66% of all net new jobs in the U.S. according to a recent post by Zane Benefits. So it should come as no surprise that with the economy generally believed to be in a slow-and-steady growth mode, the fastest growing segment appears to be that of the SMBs. This is encouraging news for those who operate in and serve this market space. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at recent findings from a Business Insider survey, including remarkable figures on planned expansion:
About the Survey
The Business Insider survey polled 300 SMBs. About 95% of respondents were a company Founder or CEO, and 52% had been in business more than 5 years (36% more than 10 years). Approximately 94% of responding companies had fewer than 50 employees. Of those responding, 84% had annual revenues smaller than $5 million. So what did these companies have to say about their plans for 2015?
Survey Says…
In short, 2015 for the surveyed SMBs will be about growth and expansion. For example, 58% of respondents said they plan to expand locally. This is up a whopping 22% from those that said they had planned to expand locally the year before. But this group didn’t just have their sights set on growing close to home; in large numbers, they also planned to expand nationally (34%) and internationally (27%). In both of these categories, the numbers were up from the previous year, with increases of 9% and 10% respectively.
With numbers like these, it’s not surprising that business owners expressed confidence heading into 2015. How confident? Nearly 1 in 4 respondents said they were “extremely confident” about their prospects. Overall, business owners had an average confidence rating of 77% (5.39 on a 7-point scale). This robust level of optimism, the report said, demonstrates “that the tumult of recent years is becoming more of a distant memory.”
Pain Points = Opportunity
Of course, even in this period of rising confidence and plans for growth, business owners admit to having persistent concerns. Two of the biggest “pain points” for business owners are that they “don’t have the time or expertise to figure everything out” (49%), and that “they have difficulty managing all the moving parts of their business” (23%). Respondents also cited concerns over the rising cost of customer acquisition as well as declining volumes for current customers.
Naturally, these concerns create opportunities for sales consultants and resources serving this market. (The survey also showed that 71% of business owners say they typically seek advice for operating their businesses.)
Priorities for 2015
So if owners of small- to medium-sized businesses are optimistic about the future and open to external advice, what are their top priorities in the coming year? Increasing revenues came in on top with 79% citing it as a priority. Establishing new customer relationships was next, at 67%; followed by a desire to increase profits (60%). Other priorities noted by more than 40% of respondents included expanding into new markets and improving customer relationships, both at 46%.
Bottom Line:
At Sales Xceleration, we are not surprised by the results of this survey. We have found that the owners of small- to medium-sized businesses are always pre-disposed to seeking outside guidance instead of adding to internal staff. They like being able to “get a piece of an expert,” such as a Sales Xceleration Outsourced VP of Sales rather than taking on the responsibility of supporting another employee.
What’s more, we know that this market is huge! In fact, in a typical US metropolitan area, there are approximately 50,000 businesses with annual sales between $500k and $10m. Of those businesses, 80% lack basic sales structures, processes and tools to effectively compete!
In other words, 8 of every 10 businesses need the help of qualified sales leadership professionals. At Sales Xceleration, we call this the “sales leadership gap” and our Advisors become the bridges for SMBs between almost certain failure and a brighter future.
And as the Business Insider survey shows, there has never been a better time to become a trusted sales resource in the SMB market space. So if you are ready to learn more about how Sales Xceleration can help you serve small- to medium-sized businesses, contact us today at 844.874.7253.

     As B2B-focused businesses navigate the changing landscape of a post-COVID economy, sales leaders must adopt and institute sales strategies to meet the demands of a business in growth or recovery mode. While the goal for a sales organization may be to sustain the growth trajectory aligned with organizational goals, the year-over-year approach to achieving success can vary significantly. Sales leadership styles depend on the current situation, the starting point, and the existing team charged to accomplish the goal. Good sales leaders find a way to achieve the annual goal; great sales leaders find ways to achieve the goal and systemize the process to allow for repeatable growth, pivots, and rapid scale. In part one of this blog series, we will highlight Growth-Focused Leadership, including actionable items to achieve lasting results.
Growth-Focused Leadership
Sales leaders focused on growth must proactively identify new market opportunities, verticals, geographies, platforms, or sales talent. They must invest in new sales channels and technologies, along with onboarding and training programs to support the growth of their sales teams and the acquisition of new client relationships.
When sales teams are in a breakout stage of growth, it can be challenging to adhere to systems and alignment on processes and approaches due to the nature of managing client expectations on a wildly rising revenue outlook. This situation demands that all of the skills of a sales leader be applied consistently and strategically across the team and sales practices.
Seasoned leaders know that hiring for an increased workload and rapidly scaling teams can be tempting. However, this approach can often lead to problems down the line. Further, we must suppress the desire to hire quickly instead of exercising patience in finding the right candidate to continue to scale teams and culture appropriately. That patience means we must endure the challenges, short-term, of being under-resourced and under a great deal of pressure to keep performing as if we had the resources already on the team. Instead, it is essential to focus on finding the right candidate who will not only be able to handle the current workload but also contribute to your team’s culture and help your organization achieve long-term success. Take the time to vet candidates carefully and consider not only their skills and experience but also their values and how they fit into your team’s dynamic. By prioritizing quality over speed, you’ll set your team up for success in the long run.
Another important consideration when building a team is to prioritize scalability. It’s easy to get caught up in your organization’s immediate needs and hire for the present moment, but it’s crucial to think about how your team will grow and evolve. Look for candidates with the potential to take on new responsibilities and leadership roles as your organization expands. Consider investing in training and professional development programs to help your team members acquire new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. By prioritizing scalability, you’ll be better equipped to adapt to changing business needs and continue to achieve success over the long term.
Discipline to proven systems is essential for leadership and having transparent KPIs and organizational goal communications. The rigor and discipline of a sales leader in a growth cycle are particularly demanding. One primary concern for leaders in this mode is talent loss due to competitive pressures to grab your resources for their growth. It would help if you had experience and discipline for these growth moments.
Growth-Focused Action Items
Identify new markets: Sales leaders must be able to identify new markets, niches, or customer segments that their business can serve. They should be able to analyze market trends, competitive landscapes, and customer needs to develop effective sales strategies. Leaders need to coach and build their teams on creating differentiation strategies for each new space entered.
Invest in sales resources: Sales leaders and business owners should invest in sales enablement tools like technologies and training programs to support the growth of their sales teams. This effort may include hiring new sales representatives, implementing new sales processes or technologies, and providing ongoing training and development opportunities.
Build Strong Culture: Cultivating a strong sales culture that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, and continuous improvement is paramount for growth. These cultures are hallmarked with high degrees of trust and camaraderie. They should encourage their sales teams to share best practices, provide feedback and support, and celebrate successes.
Coaching for Success: Sales training is a crucial part of any organization’s growth strategy. However, it’s important to remember that training is just the first step in the process. Without proper reinforcement and coaching, the information learned during training is often forgotten as salespeople get busy with their day-to-day responsibilities. Investing in ongoing sales coaching is critical to ensure that your team can effectively apply what they’ve learned in training. Sales coaching can reinforce best practices, provide individualized feedback and support, and help salespeople stay motivated and focused on their goals. By combining sales training with coaching, sales leaders can achieve lasting results and drive revenue growth for your organization.
Through coaching, you can identify areas where individual team members may be struggling and provide targeted support to help them improve. This support can include assisting salespeople in developing more effective sales strategies, providing guidance on overcoming objections and offering tips on better managing their time and workload. By investing in your team’s ongoing development through coaching, you’ll improve their skills and abilities and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Sales coaching can lead to increased engagement and job satisfaction, ultimately resulting in higher retention rates and better performance for your organization.
Adapting sales leadership to a growth-focused climate is vital to the success of the business, and requires consistency and commitment to each of these action items. Likewise, pivoting your leadership style following economic downtown or outright catastrophe is equally important. In the second part of this blog series, we will examine the behaviors and skills required of sales leaders when they enter Sales Recovery Mode.

Sales leaders focused on growth must proactively identify new market opportunities, verticals, geographies, platforms, or sales talent. They must invest in new sales channels and technologies, along with onboarding and training programs to support the growth of their sales teams and the acquisition of new client relationships.
When sales teams are in a breakout stage of growth, it can be challenging to adhere to systems and alignment on processes and approaches due to the nature of managing client expectations on a wildly rising revenue outlook. This situation demands that all of the skills of a sales leader be applied consistently and strategically across the team and sales practices.
Seasoned leaders know that hiring for an increased workload and rapidly scaling teams can be tempting. However, this approach can often lead to problems down the line. Further, we must suppress the desire to hire quickly instead of exercising patience in finding the right candidate to continue to scale teams and culture appropriately. That patience means we must endure the challenges, short-term, of being under-resourced and under a great deal of pressure to keep performing as if we had the resources already on the team. Instead, it is essential to focus on finding the right candidate who will not only be able to handle the current workload but also contribute to your team’s culture and help your organization achieve long-term success. Take the time to vet candidates carefully and consider not only their skills and experience but also their values and how they fit into your team’s dynamic. By prioritizing quality over speed, you’ll set your team up for success in the long run.
Another important consideration when building a team is to prioritize scalability. It’s easy to get caught up in your organization’s immediate needs and hire for the present moment, but it’s crucial to think about how your team will grow and evolve. Look for candidates with the potential to take on new responsibilities and leadership roles as your organization expands. Consider investing in training and professional development programs to help your team members acquire new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. By prioritizing scalability, you’ll be better equipped to adapt to changing business needs and continue to achieve success over the long term.
Discipline to proven systems is essential for leadership and having transparent KPIs and organizational goal communications. The rigor and discipline of a sales leader in a growth cycle are particularly demanding. One primary concern for leaders in this mode is talent loss due to competitive pressures to grab your resources for their growth. It would help if you had experience and discipline for these growth moments.
Growth-Focused Action Items
Identify new markets: Sales leaders must be able to identify new markets, niches, or customer segments that their business can serve. They should be able to analyze market trends, competitive landscapes, and customer needs to develop effective sales strategies. Leaders need to coach and build their teams on creating differentiation strategies for each new space entered.
Invest in sales resources: Sales leaders and business owners should invest in sales enablement tools like technologies and training programs to support the growth of their sales teams. This effort may include hiring new sales representatives, implementing new sales processes or technologies, and providing ongoing training and development opportunities.
Build Strong Culture: Cultivating a strong sales culture that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, and continuous improvement is paramount for growth. These cultures are hallmarked with high degrees of trust and camaraderie. They should encourage their sales teams to share best practices, provide feedback and support, and celebrate successes.
Coaching for Success: <a href=""https://salesxceleration.com/sales-leadership-training/""><strong>proven sales leadership training</strong></a> is a crucial part of any organization’s growth strategy. However, it’s important to remember that training is just the first step in the process. Without proper reinforcement and coaching, the information learned during training is often forgotten as salespeople get busy with their day-to-day responsibilities. Investing in ongoing sales coaching is critical to ensure that your team can effectively apply what they’ve learned in training. Sales coaching can reinforce best practices, provide individualized feedback and support, and help salespeople stay motivated and focused on their goals. By combining sales training with coaching, sales leaders can achieve lasting results and drive revenue growth for your organization.
Through coaching, you can identify areas where individual team members may be struggling and provide targeted support to help them improve. This support can include assisting salespeople in developing more effective sales strategies, providing guidance on overcoming objections and offering tips on better managing their time and workload. By investing in your team’s ongoing development through coaching, you’ll improve their skills and abilities and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Sales coaching can lead to increased engagement and job satisfaction, ultimately resulting in higher retention rates and better performance for your organization.
Adapting sales leadership to a growth-focused climate is vital to the success of the business, and requires consistency and commitment to each of these action items. Likewise, pivoting your leadership style following economic downtown or outright catastrophe is equally important. In the second part of this blog series, we will examine the behaviors and skills required of sales leaders when they enter Sales Recovery Mode.

/**/In today’s ever-expanding “gig economy,” outsourcing entry-level tasks and job roles has become commonplace. But a growing number of organizations are exploring and adopting outsourcing for higher-level functions, too. Small to mid-sized sales organizations are increasingly outsourcing the sales function – from the sales rep role to executive sales management – and finding success with this new paradigm.
What are some key reasons for sales outsourcing (and some reasons why a company might not want to)? Let’s take a look:
Advantages of Outsourcing Your Sales Function
While businesses have learned it can be lucrative to outsource frontline sales functions such as lead generation, now, small to mid-sized businesses are beginning to understand benefits at higher levels – sales leadership levels – in the sales organization. The use of outsourced fractional sales leaders, is rapidly gaining recognition as a means of attaining an essential competitive advantage in the marketplace. In fact, Salesforce named “Outsourcing the Sales Function” as the #4 trend upending sales today.
Businesses today are increasingly turning to outsourced sales leaders to help turn around a struggling business and/or enhance revenue growth opportunities for many different reasons.

Current revenue and sales performance may be declining or stagnant quarter-over-quarter and year-over year, signaling a dire situation if not addressed.
Current sales team members and processes may not be driving desired results.
Disruptive market and/or industry competitors have changed the “rules of the game” beyond the capabilities of current sales leaders and reps.
The historically hands-on business owner or CEO no longer has the time or expertise to oversee critical changes in the sales function

From strategic direction to process changes to sales team member management. Bringing in an outsourced sales leader can free the owner or CEO to concentrate on other aspects of the business, including providing visionary oversight of the larger organization.
Outsourced sales leaders bring external perspective to add market-based clarity to the sales function. With an outsourced sales leader, the business can gain essential expertise to strategically expand market influence, including global expansions.
Based on a strong track record of success in larger markets, an outsourced sales leader can develop and implement new sales strategies and processes. Fractional sales leaders can help recruit, train, and onboard new sales talent to succeed within new sales strategies and processes without having to “unlearn” bad habits. An Outsourced VP of Sales can make the tough decisions necessary to increase efficiency, control costs, and better align resources. This level of strategic execution is the essence of effective sales management consulting.

Disadvantages for Outsourcing Your Sales Function
With all the benefits that can be realized outsourcing the sales function, why would a small to mid-sized business not want to implement this likely competitive advantage? Here are five possible reasons:

The business owner or leadership team wants to maintain full internal control amongst current staff (perhaps for a family-run business) – even if that means sacrificing potential benefits noted above
Aspects of the business operation might be deemed confidential or sensitive to a level that rules out bringing in a fractional resource
Current leaders want to remain “hands on” in running day-to-day company operations, even if they have little time for essential sales growth strategy consulting.
Although sales outsourcing pricing is usually custom based on company needs, and includes a value proposition designed for near- and long-term ROI, the business might not financially able to engage the services of a fractional Outsourced VP of Sales in the short-term
The current company culture is in a fragile state and it is feared (rightly or wrongly) that bringing in an external resource will cause unwanted ripples

The Bottom Line:
It is important for any business to weigh outsourcing advantages and disadvantages before taking that plunge. Nonetheless, the reasons for outsourcing can often outweigh reasons against. Certainly, for many smaller businesses, outsourced sales leadership can be the difference between long-term success and short-term failure.

The American Business Awards are the U.S.A.’s premier business awards program. All organizations operating in the U.S.A. are eligible to submit nominations – public and private, for-profit and non-profit, large and small.

https://salesxceleration.com/gray-hair-boosts-consultant-credentials/,"
     It’s ironic that many of the traits undervalued in the corporate environment – age, experience, wisdom, and gray hair – can actually add to consultant credentials. In other words, the very traits that may have kept sales professionals from being listened to and valued during the latter part of their corporate careers  will very likely serve them well as sales consultants. Let’s take a closer look at why:
Age Discrimination is Real
In a recent Washington Post article titled “Baby boomers are taking on ageism — and losing”, the persistent reality of age discrimination becomes pointedly clear. “At a time when conditions have vastly improved for women, gay people, disabled people and minorities in the workplace,” the Post reports, “prejudice against older workers remains among the most acceptable and pervasive ‘isms’.”
The article goes on to say that changes in the modern workplace “have created new types of ageism that are more subtle and widespread,” and that companies sometimes favor younger employees who don’t carry the financial baggage of higher salaries, pensions and healthcare costs.
Beyond this, “millennials” find older workers to be the “biggest roadblocks” to their own advancement according to a 2015 Harris Poll. This is echoed by Michael North, an assistant professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, who states that “younger people tend to resent it when older workers don’t “get out of the way” and retire.”
Age discrimination also plays a large role when senior leaders are looking for their next sales leadership role. After all, you can only hide your age from a new company for so long. Roles you once would have been a “shoo-in” for, you now find that you aren’t even in the running.
Making Lemonade from Lemons to Elevate Your Consultant Credentials
Many senior sales professionals wake up to find they no longer have the organizational clout they once enjoyed. They sense a creeping disaffection from those in charge in favor of the younger up-and-comer. And as those in the C-suite themselves become younger, aging sales leaders may find their experience carrying less weight, while “fresh” ideas from younger salespeople – even clearly misguided ideas – gain favor.
Such is often the plight of the seasoned sales professional in the large corporate environment. It’s a story many of our licensed Advisors at Sales Xceleration relate to because they, too, are often richly experienced corporate sales refugees. What they have found, however, is that the baggage of being older in a large corporate environment becomes a plus and adds to their consultant credentials when they provide outsourced sales solutions to small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). They find that owners of these businesses are often desperate for the kind of wisdom and direction that can only come from many years of success in the sales industry – wisdom they typically haven’t had access to in the past.
The “Sully” Factor
In fact, it’s been our experience – shared with so many of our Advisors – that the SMB owner who may be reluctant to put faith in a younger sales consultant often finds comfort  and value in having a more experienced consultant beside them at the controls. Let’s call this the “Sully” factor, in honor of Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger. Sully, as you’ll recall, was the “Hero of the Hudson” who, in 2009, successfully landed US Airways flight 1549 on New York’s Hudson River after an in-flight emergency, saving 155 passengers and crew. SMB owners are not unlike the frightened passengers on that flight, comforted and relieved to have a deeply experienced and wise pilot at the helm. And because many of these smaller businesses turn to consultants when their business is in a serious decline, this reliance on competence enhanced with wisdom only makes sense.
The Bottom Line:
As sales professionals approach or pass age 50, their large corporate employers may begin to favor younger sales executives who are believed to have more energy and newer ideas. The truth is, however, that the seasoned sales professional knows how to work smarter and focus on ideas and initiatives with proven results that can quickly escalate a company’s bottom line. In the smaller business environment, their gray hair is no longer a negative, but rather a badge of honor, recognized as having been earned via many years of success in some of the toughest sales environments around. Small business owners can more easily value this wisdom and experience. And they are often surprised to learn that a top sales professional they could never afford to hire full-time can bring tremendous return on investment in short-term or part-time consultant engagements.

https://salesxceleration.com/5-ways-to-assess-sales-performance-amid-a-global-pandemic/,"
     The COVID-19 pandemic has touched every single part of the economy, including — or especially — sales. Businesses have seen existing customers delay reordering and new customers wait to make their first purchases, and some companies are holding onto cash rather than investing in their business. But their singular focus on the here and now has likely blinded them to how different their businesses and sales processes will look in the future.
Every business is different, of course, and each company must grapple with its unique challenges. Many nonessential businesses were forced to cease or limit operations, and they have suffered deeply as a result. Case in point: Retail sales dipped by 16.4% in April due to widespread stay-at-home orders that shuttered bars, restaurants, and many stores.
Some companies are in a holding pattern because they don’t know the extent to which they have been disrupted; others have experienced deep losses. As an example, auto industry sales dropped by 36.6% between March and April of this year. Sales will return at some point, but it’s unclear when or to what degree. Meanwhile, other businesses have benefited from the pandemic because they provide products and services that have soared in demand: Walmart’s online sales increased by 74% — and its revenue grew by nearly 9% — while grocery, delivery, and online conferencing companies also thrived.
In short, COVID-19 has affected everyone’s sales in some way (either positively or negatively). And those numbers will naturally influence mergers and acquisitions (M&A) decisions for a long time to come.
PE And M&A Deals in a Post-Pandemic World
Unsurprisingly, M&A deals declined during the pandemic. What activity there has been concentrated largely around acquisitions, as solid companies sought to purchase businesses unlikely to survive the downturn, according to Boston Consulting Group. In April alone, private equity (PE) deals decreased by 64% compared with April 2019.
But what will the PE and M&A landscape look like post-coronavirus? PE and M&A firms will show some sympathy when looking at businesses’ 2020 sales numbers, including earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA). They know this year threw companies unprecedented challenges and that almost nobody will come through the pandemic unscathed.
However, this sympathy can only go so far. Ultimately, PE and M&A firms must assign businesses proper valuations and understand where these organizations are headed. Is a company’s upward sales trend permanently disrupted, or will it quickly recover once people return to work? Will the business be at pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2020? If not, how long will it take the leadership team to fight their way back?
Deal benchmarks aren’t likely to change much, but the context through which they’re viewed has evolved. Even allowing for COVID-19 anomalies, sales projections may look very different now than they did even a few months ago because companies are operating in a changing economy.
That’s not to say a struggling business can’t attract a PE or M&A firm’s interest in a deal. But the offer may be diminished from what it might have been, or the deal may be put on hold until the company’s performance recovers.
Evaluating Sales in a New World
It’s important for firms to think clearly about how to assess sales performance going forward. It may not be helpful to factor the worst months of the crisis too heavily into a company’s projections. What you need to know is whether a sales drop was a pandemic-related anomaly or the continuation of a trend that began well before the downturn. As the economy picks up, you’ll want to look at whether the company regains momentum or is still mired in lagging sales.
But you’ll have to dig deeper to understand not only whether sales will increase but also whether the business remains sustainable. The following questions will help in that sales performance assessment:
1. When will EBITA numbers return to — or surpass — pre-pandemic levels?
Use information from sales reports. If a business has yet to reach its pre-pandemic revenue and EBITA levels, consider whether it will ever get back there. How long might it take, and what will be the new run rate? Look, too, at what type of growth is realistic. You need to know if it can ever fulfill its previous forecasts.
The sales team will play a crucial role in accelerating recovery and growth, so inquire about what it is doing to drive the numbers back up. Start by examining the current sales pipeline, given how predictive that can be for future sales. You must consider where those prospects are in the sales process so that you understand the timing of that revenue.
2. Does the sales strategy need to change post-coronavirus?
Following on the previous point, assess whether a business needs to develop a new agile sales strategy in light of the new circumstances. Should the company focus on larger or smaller accounts than it did in the past? Should it invest in new products that are more relevant in the context of the virus? If sales team members will return to business as usual, how do they know their strategies still apply? And if changes are necessary, how have salespeople tweaked their customer and client targets and go-to-market strategies for new products? Asking these questions will provide insight into how deeply the company’s leadership has analyzed its new position in the market.
3. Does the company have enough qualified staff for a successful sales pivot?
If a company plans to change sales tactics, it needs to ensure it has the appropriate sales leadership and sales representatives to implement those changes. Make sure that the business has retained the requisite number of team members and that they have the right skills for the company’s next act.
If the company previously focused on small businesses, for instance, is the sales team prepared to sell to larger, more complex organizations? The business may need to invest in retraining sales personnel — or potentially hiring new salespeople — before it can pursue new target clients.
4. Is the sales leadership team capable of the challenges ahead?
In addition to having the right people on the sales team, companies need the right sales leaders. You need sales leaders who can take the sales organization toward a new set of goals. The current leadership team might be ready to handle the stress and challenges of change, or they might be only suited to stable, easier economies. If they can’t adapt to the new normal, you may want to discuss replacing them as part of the deal.
5. Can the company survive the recession?
Looking beyond the immediate crisis, businesses need to prepare to survive the current recession. It’s unclear how long a full economic recovery will take, though it could be many months or years. The organizations likely to survive are the ones that define a clear sales contingency plan that enables them to survive COVID-19 and prosper during the recession.
Sales growth during these interesting times requires that PE and M&A firms — as well as the companies they are targeting — have a realistic understanding of what it will take to succeed in this volatile environment. Adaptability and a keen understanding of the changing market will determine who thrives and who struggles.

    ","
     The COVID-19 pandemic has touched every single part of the economy, including — or especially — sales. Businesses have seen existing customers delay reordering and new customers wait to make their first purchases, and some companies are holding onto cash rather than investing in their business. But their singular focus on the here and now has likely blinded them to how different their businesses and sales processes will look in the future.
Every business is different, of course, and each company must grapple with its unique challenges. Many nonessential businesses were forced to cease or limit operations, and they have suffered deeply as a result. Case in point: Retail sales dipped by 16.4% in April due to widespread stay-at-home orders that shuttered bars, restaurants, and many stores.
Some companies are in a holding pattern because they don’t know the extent to which they have been disrupted; others have experienced deep losses. As an example, auto industry sales dropped by 36.6% between March and April of this year. Sales will return at some point, but it’s unclear when or to what degree. Meanwhile, other businesses have benefited from the pandemic because they provide products and services that have soared in demand: Walmart’s online sales increased by 74% — and its revenue grew by nearly 9% — while grocery, delivery, and online conferencing companies also thrived.
In short, COVID-19 has affected everyone’s sales in some way (either positively or negatively). And those numbers will naturally influence mergers and acquisitions (M&A) decisions for a long time to come.
PE And M&A Deals in a Post-Pandemic World
Unsurprisingly, M&A deals declined during the pandemic. What activity there has been concentrated largely around acquisitions, as solid companies sought to purchase businesses unlikely to survive the downturn, according to Boston Consulting Group. In April alone, private equity (PE) deals decreased by 64% compared with April 2019.
But what will the PE and M&A landscape look like post-coronavirus? PE and M&A firms will show some sympathy when looking at businesses’ 2020 sales numbers, including earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA). They know this year threw companies unprecedented challenges and that almost nobody will come through the pandemic unscathed.
However, this sympathy can only go so far. Ultimately, PE and M&A firms must assign businesses proper valuations and understand where these organizations are headed. Is a company’s upward sales trend permanently disrupted, or will it quickly recover once people return to work? Will the business be at pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2020? If not, how long will it take the leadership team to fight their way back?
Deal benchmarks aren’t likely to change much, but the context through which they’re viewed has evolved. Even allowing for COVID-19 anomalies, sales projections may look very different now than they did even a few months ago because companies are operating in a changing economy.
That’s not to say a struggling business can’t attract a PE or M&A firm’s interest in a deal. But the offer may be diminished from what it might have been, or the deal may be put on hold until the company’s performance recovers.

If you’ve ever followed qualifications for the Indianapolis 500, you know that IndyCar drivers try not only to “make the race” but also to “set the pace” and win the pole position for race day. You know that they typically make dozens of practice runs in the days and weeks leading up to qualifications, taking lap times and making small adjustments, fine-tuning their machines in search of excellence and that all-important goal: being the best when it counts – during qualifications and during the race. 
And, if you’ve followed the history of qualifications for the Indy 500, you probably know about legendary broadcaster and Indianapolis Motor Speedway track announcer Tom Carnegie. In his six decades as the “Voice of the Speedway,” Carnegie became famous for two signature phrases: “Heeeeee’s on it!” and “It’s a new track record!” What do these phrases have to do with sales leadership consulting?
“Heeeeee’s on it!”
Carnegie first became the speedway’s announcer in 1946, roughly three decades before Janet Guthrie became the first female driver to qualify for the 500. So, even though he also often used the phrase, “Sheeeeee’s on it!” for Guthrie, Sarah Fisher, Lyn St. James, and others, he is most famous for the earlier version. To Carnegie and race fans, “Heeeeee’s on it!” meant the driver had taken the green flag and was just starting to lay it all on the line to post a qualifying time fast enough to make the race – or perhaps win “the pole.”
In sales, the phrase could be used to signify a sales leader focusing on accelerating sales and gaining market position over competitors. Sales leaders are those sales professionals, including managers and executives, who find ways to turn up the power and drive sales success. Like their racing counterparts, they use their skill, knowledge, and competitive drive to assess their position, make adjustments (sometimes big, sometimes small), and work their way forward into a position of leadership. Simply put, it’s what winners do!
“It’s a new track record!” 
At Indy, the search for success begins with the search for speed. Each new track record in qualifying is built from lessons learned from previous attempts and a history of making the adjustments necessary to achieve optimal performance. It’s the same for a sales leadership professional. Each sales success and failure, creates deeper experience and wisdom that leads to better sales results. As a sales leader progresses through a corporate career, often rising from sales rep to sales manager to VP of Sales, more skills are acquired, and those skills most often lead to a solid track record of success and achievement. 
But what happens at the end of the corporate sales career? Do those acquired skills no longer provide value? Does that long track record of success vanish? It certainly doesn’t have to. If you’re like the sales leaders who have become sales leadership consultants with Sales Xceleration, you can use your track record as a turbo boost into a new career of success serving small to mid-sized businesses in desperate need of sales leaders – winners who can utilize their experience and wisdom to take these clients to the front of the pack. This is the primary objective of a professional sales management consultant.
In other words, sales leadership consultants are “on it” as they turn their track records of success into “new track records” of opportunity. The best part is that Sales Xceleration’s proven sales tools and systems fuel this success – for consultants and their clients.

     If your company sales are stalled or declining, then it’s time to ask if you are doing all you can in order to develop a winning sales team. To ignore key areas of your sales structure could be fatal to the health of your business. Already examined these areas a year ago? Then it’s time to examine them again. So, what can your company do to ensure it will thrive and effectively compete in today’s selling environment?
Using your gut is okay, but add some science to your hunches.
If you’ve hired salespeople using your gut, you aren’t alone. That salesperson you just hired is so charming, and talk about a perfect resume!  But fast forward six months, and that perfect person has alienated several current and prospective customers.
Have you ever passed over a sales candidate because they didn’t have industry experience, only to learn that they were hired by your closest competitor? And that new hire has already wooed three large clients away from your company?
Every employer can benefit from using a proven sales assessment tool that will add some science to the hiring process. Speaking from experience, an assessment tool I’ve used for years has prevented me from making many hiring mistakes. In one instance, I ignored the findings of the tool in favor of “my gut” and ended up hiring the wrong person for a sales management role.
Many assessment tools are also accompanied by a series of behavioral interview questions that will further assist you in determining fit for your sales role.
Has your sales team turnover been high? Have you struggled to attract top talent?
Does your current incentive compensation plan encourage your salespeople to land new business and continue to upsell existing customers?  If your sales are stagnant or declining, then consider an immediate plan to evaluate the current compensation.
Figuring out how to compensate salespeople effectively is pretty challenging if you do not have a background in sales leadership.  Bringing in an experienced, outsourced sales advisor to help you evaluate and overhaul your plan will save you time and money, and will likely prevent top performing sales people from leaving. In all of my corporate sales leadership roles, we brought in an outsourced advisor (one with a track record of building winning comp plans) to help us rebuild the compensation structure. The results of implementing a new plan? The sales people embraced the plan immediately and sales grew quickly and dramatically.
If you want to get there fast, use a map. Why hiring a great sales team isn’t enough.
You’d never use your gut (no map, just your gut) to take a cross country trip that was going to involve stops at ten key landmarks you’ve been dying to see. Or, maybe you would, and who knows if or when you’d accomplish the goals you set for the trip?
Many businesses fail every single day because they don’t have a road map (a strategy) to sales growth. Even the right sales team (whom you’ve assessed for fit) and the right compensation plan (one that you’ve built with the help of an experienced comp plan builder) isn’t enough – not having a road map will make sales growth impossible.
Sometimes you’ve got the right people on your current executive team who can work together to build a solid sales strategy. But more often than not, the team doesn’t have the time or the experience. I know of a very large company that just rolled out a sales plan that was not built to motivate sales people; it was built to satisfy shareholders.
An outsourced sales leader can align your sales strategy with the changing times; they’re out in the marketplace with other businesses similar to yours, so they know what has worked and what has not. Delivering this market-proven perspective is a cornerstone of sales management consulting. A strategy and structure is not all that different from the ones you probably have in place for your warehouses, and other functions of your business. And an effective strategy will be embraced by your sales team because they’ll have a clear understanding of their roles and the road map to success.
Today’s selling marketplace has shifted towards a more structured and accountable environment. If your company embraces strategic sales consulting and continuous improvement to the process of building a winning sales team, it will be in a position to thrive today and in the future.

https://salesxceleration.com/what-is-a-sales-leadership-consultant-why-are-they-needed-and-why-should-you-be-one/,"
     Simply put, a sales leadership consultant is an expert who is experienced in selling and sales management. An expert who can help an organization build and/or improve its sales strategies, sales processes, sales tools, and sales systems. An expert who specializes in driving revenue growth by improving sales. 
What does this mean in day-to-day action? The sales leadership consultant must be an innovator, strategist, and a tactician; an analyst, manager, coach, and leader, too. To succeed, a sales leadership consultant must be intuitive, confident, and persuasive – and maintain a big-picture perspective while implementing smaller initiatives that align with larger goals. A sales leadership consultant must be a good communicator, too. And a proven sales leader who can advocate for the client and make difficult recommendations and decisions.
Why are Sales Leadership Consultants So Important to Smaller Businesses? 
Small to mid-sized businesses typically have smaller staffs. This can limit their ability to invest in sales executives with the kind of broad-based experience, expertise and actionable wisdom necessary to significantly “move the needle” for substantial sales gains. By bringing in a dedicated sales leadership consultant, however, usually for a limited time and on a “fractional” time basis (for example, one or two days a week for several months), the smaller business can benefit from corporate-level guidance without the burden of a corporate-level salary. In other words, the business can utilize top sales leadership consulting talent without the full-time top-talent cost. This creates a distinct competitive advantage for companies that engage a sales management consultant. 
Why Should an Experienced Sales Leader Consider Sales Leadership Consulting?
Many accomplished corporate sales leaders, after decades of climbing the corporate ladder, eventually reach the top rung and yet still yearn for more. Tired of the corporate grind – especially all the travel and time away from home – they seek to work with purpose, to utilize their talents and passions, to make a difference where they are needed most. 
Consider how Vance, the Sales Management Consultant character in Mark Thacker’s book, Hope Realized: Finding the Path to Sales Success, described the benefits of becoming a sales leadership consultant after a long career of corporate success:
“Not only do I now have more control and a greatly improved work/life balance; and not only do I feel important and valued again – I feel like I’m making a real difference these days, because now I also have the opportunity to help these business owners and leaders take back portions of their own lives… You might say I’m a pathfinder, helping [owners of small to mid-sized businesses] identify, illuminate and navigate pathways to new levels of success.” 
He continued, by saying:
“…I went from dreading what the next business day had for me to waking up excited by the opportunity to help make other people successful and happy. I guess I lead a pretty fulfilling life these days.”
It’s the kind of testimonial that is commonly shared by sales leadership consultants enjoying their post-corporate professional lives.
The Bottom Line:
Sales leadership consultants bring fresh big-picture corporate perspectives that can empower a smaller organization to drive toward formerly unattainable revenue goals. Because of this, small to mid-sized businesses crave their services to outperform the competition and gain market share. For professional sales leaders, becoming a sales leadership consultant empowers them to utilize their strengths, work with passion and purpose, and make a bigger impact than ever before.

This creates a distinct competitive advantage for companies that engage a sales management consultant. 
Why Should an Experienced Sales Leader Consider Sales Leadership Consulting?
Many accomplished corporate sales leaders, after decades of climbing the corporate ladder, eventually reach the top rung and yet still yearn for more. Tired of the corporate grind – especially all the travel and time away from home – they seek to work with purpose, to utilize their talents and passions, to make a difference where they are needed most. 
Consider how Vance, the Sales Management Consultant character in Mark Thacker’s book, Hope Realized: Finding the Path to Sales Success, described the benefits of becoming a sales leadership consultant after a long career of corporate success:
“Not only do I now have more control and a greatly improved work/life balance; and not only do I feel important and valued again – I feel like I’m making a real difference these days, because now I also have the opportunity to help these business owners and leaders take back portions of their own lives… You might say I’m a pathfinder, helping [owners of small to mid-sized businesses] identify, illuminate and navigate pathways to new levels of success.” 
He continued, by saying:
“…I went from dreading what the next business day had for me to waking up excited by the opportunity to help make other people successful and happy. I guess I lead a pretty fulfilling life these days.”
It’s the kind of testimonial that is commonly shared by sales leadership consultants enjoying their post-corporate professional lives.
The Bottom Line:
<a href=""https://salesxceleration.com/sales-leadership-training/""><strong>scalable sales leadership training</strong></a> consultants bring fresh big-picture corporate perspectives that can empower a smaller organization to drive toward formerly unattainable revenue goals. Because of this, small to mid-sized businesses crave their services to outperform the competition and gain market share. For professional sales leaders, becoming a sales leadership consultant empowers them to utilize their strengths, work with passion and purpose, and make a bigger impact than ever before.

     When hiring new talent for your team, you may be wondering whether an Account Manager (AM) or a Business Development Representative (BDR) role is a better fit for your prospective employee. While both roles are critical to the success of any sales team, they have some key differences in terms of responsibilities, activities, and compensation. Examining the main differences between AMs and BDRs will help you determine which role will be the best fit to round out your team. For a deeper dive into optimizing your sales team structure, consider exploring sales strategy consulting.
Account Manager (AM)
You no doubt already know that an Account Manager is responsible for managing and expanding relationships with existing customers. But breaking down their responsibilities and how they spend their time will allow you to ascertain if your new hire is suited to this routine. Account Managing typically involves a mix of activities such as:

Maintaining regular contact with customers (50%)
Upselling and cross-selling products and services (20%)
Identifying new opportunities within existing accounts (15%)
Managing and resolving customer issues (10%)
Collaborating with other teams (5%)

AMs have a set of accounts that they are responsible for managing and growing. They work closely with their customers to understand their needs and identify opportunities to improve their experience and increase sales.
One key difference between AMs and BDRs is the focus on existing customers. AMs are expected to have a deep understanding of their customers’ business, their needs, and to use this knowledge to drive sales and increase customer satisfaction. They are also expected to have strong relationships with their customers, which can take time to build.
Compensation for AMs is usually based on a mix of salary and commission. AMs typically earn higher salaries than BDRs, as their role requires more experience and responsibility. However, the potential for commission is typically lower than for BDRs, as AMs are working with existing accounts rather than generating new business.
Business Development Representative (BDR)
If Account Managing is not the right fit, it is possible your new hire would be better suited for a role in Business Development. Business Development Representatives are responsible for generating new business for the company. This typically involves a mix of activities such as:

Researching and identifying potential new customers (40%)
Contacting and qualifying leads (30%)
Setting up appointments and demonstrations (20%)
Collaborating with other teams (10%)

BDRs typically work on a larger volume of leads than AMs, as they are focused on generating new business rather than maintaining and expanding existing relationships. This can involve a lot of outreach and prospecting, as well as identifying and qualifying leads.
One key difference between BDRs and AMs is the focus on new business. BDRs are expected to have a strong understanding of the company’s products and services and to be able to articulate their value to potential customers. They are also expected to be able to identify and prioritize the most promising leads and to work effectively with the sales team to close deals.
Compensation for BDRs is usually based on a mix of salary and commission. BDRs typically earn lower salaries than AMs, as their role requires less experience and responsibility. However, the potential for commission is typically higher than for AMs, as BDRs are responsible for generating new business.
Deciding between an Account Manager and a Business Development Representative role for a new hire can be a challenging choice, as both roles offer unique opportunities and challenges, while requiring a similar skill set. If the candidate excels at building and maintaining strong relationships with customers, an AM role may be a good fit. If they crave the challenge of identifying and qualifying new leads and working with a team to close deals, they may be better suited to a BDR role. Do NOT turn a great BDR into an AM and do not try to turn a great AM into a BDR—they are different types of people/personalities. Ultimately, the right role will depend on strengths, interests, and career goals. Both AMs and BDRs play critical roles in the success of any sales team.

https://salesxceleration.com/top-4-challenges-facing-small-business-owners-today/,"
     I have had the pleasure to interact with many small business owners and CEOs over the past year.  I’ve also spoken to many advisors in various disciplines who also interact with the owners of these small companies.  What I have found is that most business owners of small companies are faced with four common challenges, whether they are successful and experiencing growth, or not.  What is interesting is that these challenges are not unique from company to company – even across diverse industries!  Is your company facing challenges?  If so, chances are they are in my “Top 4.”  Read on to learn what these challenges are and how to address them head on!
Financial Knowledge:
Many small companies need a deeper understanding of their financial situation and what affects the numbers.  Too often I see a small business owner managing their business by what the number is in their checking account, but they don’t really understand what their Profit and Loss Statement is and how it works.
Do you know what your net profit is?  Do you understand your expenses by department or by areas in your business?  Do you know what levers to pull to impact your P&L the way you want to?  Most small business owners and CEOs need a deeper understanding in this area.
Here are possible ways to obtain financial knowledge:

Set a time with your CPA and ask them to explain the monthly P&L in detail. If they can’t, then you need to find one who can!
Hire an Outsourced CFO. Look for one that focuses on strategy rather than how to process the numbers.  They can help you plan out your future and coach you on how to impact your P&L.
Find a class or seminar in your area from the Small Business Administration or SCORE.

Sales and Marketing:
Most small business owners are excellent in sales themselves because they built the product or service that their company is founded on, but they don’t have the time or want to manage their sales team the way it needs to be managed.  A sales team can’t be managed with a hands-off approach.  They need to be pushed and held accountable, while at the same time provided with marketing tools to drive the results the company needs.
Are your salespeople asking for more “tools” to help them grow?  Is your team not developing enough new business?  Do you dread every time the phone rings from one of your sales team members?
Try some of these proven practices:

Update your website – hire someone to help you! It’s worth the investment, and make sure it is mobile ready!  Everyone does business on their phones today.
Seek outsourced sales help. Take advantage of the years of sales leadership experience from a Sales Xceleration Advisor on an interim basis to help your company.
Look for an outsourced marketing person or agency. Marketing takes a consistent, strategic approach to be effective over the long haul.
Educate yourself so you understand the sales process or digital marketing better. There are many organization that offer free training in these areas, just google them!

People:
Human capital is a critical piece of your company.  Do you feel like you have all the right people on your “bus” and in the right seats?  Are you compliant with all the laws that your state has for employees?  Does your company have the culture you want?  Managing people effectively and implementing your company’s benefits, retirement plans and hiring practices takes time and expertise!
Consider these options to help you with your people:

Find a reliable company to help you administer your payroll, benefits, retirement plans, etc. There are many great companies out there today that specialize in this and can help protect you!
Establish a performance management system or find an EOS Implementer in your area to help you.
Find an outsourced human resource professional to help you establish best business practices and systems to help your company.

Time:
I’ve saved the best and biggest opportunity for last!  Time – there is never enough of it!  Where does it all go?  Unless you can figure out a way to create more hours in a day, you will need to challenge yourself to be more productive with the time you have.  Most owners and CEOs at small companies feel stressed and overworked.  They fret about having to spend too much time IN their business versus ON their business!  Does this sound familiar?
Try these ideas:

Learn to delegate! This is where outsourced experts in their fields can really help a small business owner.  Let them remove some of the “day-to-day” from your desk so you can focus on your strengths to help your company grow!
Try some of the ideas in the common challenge areas mentioned above that will give you more time!
Say “No” to some things. You can’t be everything to everyone.  You must stay true to what your company excels at and be cautious about chasing things that aren’t your company’s strength.
Learn to manage your calendar. Take an Outlook class or tutorial on-line.  The better you can manage your calendar, the more productive your days and weeks will become!

If you are challenged by any one or all four of these things – Time, People, Financial Knowledge or Sales and Marketing – please know that you are not alone!  Other business leaders face the same challenges that you do every day!  All of us at Sales Xceleration are here to help you!  We are the experts in the sales arena, but we also have many trusted advisors in our network that can help you in the other areas as well.  Reach out to your local Sales Xceleration Advisor for a free consultation and begin your journey to improve your business!

Is Your Sales Manager Still Selling? Big Mistake. Here’s Why:

What if You Just Can’t Afford a Sales Superstar?


    ",scalable sales leadership training,scalable,replace_existing_phrase,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/turn-buyer-insights-into-sales-wins-the-power-of-b2b-analytics/,"
     The complexity of business-to-business (B2B) sales is rarely simple, and the buyer journey is often anything but straightforward. Instead of a clean, linear path, the process tends to involve:

In-depth research by the buyer
Comparisons across multiple vendors and solutions
Cross-functional discussions and approvals
Complex decision-making involving several stakeholders

In other words, managing the B2B buyer journey from the seller’s perspective can be cumbersome, confusing, and time-consuming. These challenges can also increase costs.
To overcome these challenges and support sustainable growth, businesses need a more effective way to manage their journey. B2B buyer journey analytics and
data-driven sales strategies provide the structure necessary to simplify the user’s journey and achieve better outcomes.
B2B Selling: Then vs. Now
Traditionally, B2B sales leaned heavily on intuition and anecdotal experience—what worked before was expected to work again. Seasoned sales professionals relied on gut instinct, relationships, and lessons learned through trial and error.
But today, that’s no longer enough. The complexity of the buyer journey—and the volume of data it generates—demands a smarter, more structured approach. By using sales analytics and data-driven strategies, modern sales teams can shift from reactive to proactive, turning insights into a repeatable advantage.

Leveraging Analytics for Better Insights
B2B analytics don’t just reveal what’s happening, they explain why deals succeed or stall, and how to refine your approach over time. Typically, via a powerful Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI), analytics can track, measure, interpret, and help teams act on data gathered from each buyer touch point.
By analyzing these “digital footprints,” sales leaders can uncover where prospects are engaging, where they’re dropping off, and why. For instance, if buyer interest consistently dips after one particular piece of content, it’s a signal to reassess its message or placement. Conversely, identifying content that correlates with conversion opens the door to amplify what’s working.
Beyond content strategy, analytics play a critical role in lead scoring and qualification. Instead of treating all prospects equally, sales teams can use real-time data to prioritize the most engaged, high-intent buyers. This approach reduces wasted effort, focuses on high-value deals, and creates a more efficient, predictable sales process.
Optimizing the Sales Cycle with Data
A significant benefit from leveraging B2B buyer journey analytics is its direct impact on the length of the sales cycle. An extended sales cycle can monopolize resources, postpone revenue, and sacrifice more lucrative opportunities. Using analytics can efficiently accelerate that sales cycle.
Understanding how long each stage of the buyer journey typically takes helps teams set realistic expectations and spot potential delays early. Analytics can reveal:

Bottlenecks by stage – For example, if the negotiation phase drags, it may signal the need for better pricing strategies or objection-handling
Fast-track behaviors – Identifying actions that correlate with quicker conversions lets reps engage at the right time with the right message.
Predictive close insights – Data can highlight which leads are most likely to close soon, helping teams prioritize efforts and forecast more

Personalizing the Buyer Experience
Today’s consumers expect the kinds of personalized interactions that B2B buyer journey analytics can deliver.
Consider segmenting customers by:

Industry
Company size
Pain points
Behavior within the pipeline

These insights help you craft more tailored messaging and content. For example, if a prospect downloads an e-book on cybersecurity challenges, the sales team can follow up with targeted information on cybersecurity solutions, rather than general product details.
Start Your Data-Driven Journey
The B2B buyer journey encompasses the entire experience a customer has with your brand, from initial awareness to sales, service, and support. At every point along this journey, the buyer leaves digital footprints and forms or reinforces opinions about your brand. That’s why integrating B2B buyer journey analytics and deploying effective data-driven strategies can help optimize the journey to accelerate growth and to create and maintain a consistent, positive experience that fosters customer satisfaction, loyalty, and referrals.

Sales Xceleration Spotlight: Why Many Small Businesses Don’t Prepare a Sales Forecast

Focus on Sales Growth: The Accountability Factor


    ","
     The complexity of business-to-business (B2B) sales is rarely simple, and the buyer journey is often anything but straightforward. Instead of a clean, linear path, the process tends to involve:

In-depth research by the buyer
Comparisons across multiple vendors and solutions
Cross-functional discussions and approvals
Complex decision-making involving several stakeholders

In other words, managing the B2B buyer journey from the seller’s perspective can be cumbersome, confusing, and time-consuming. These challenges can also increase costs.
To overcome these challenges and support sustainable growth, businesses need a more effective way to manage their journey. B2B buyer journey analytics and
data-driven sales strategies provide the structure necessary to simplify the user’s journey and achieve better outcomes.
B2B Selling: Then vs. Now
Traditionally, B2B sales leaned heavily on intuition and anecdotal experience—what worked before was expected to work again. Seasoned sales professionals relied on gut instinct, relationships, and lessons learned through trial and error.
But today, that’s no longer enough. The complexity of the buyer journey—and the volume of data it generates—demands a smarter, more structured approach. By using sales analytics and data-driven strategies, modern sales teams can shift from reactive to proactive, turning insights into a repeatable advantage.

B2B analytics don’t just reveal what’s happening, they explain why deals succeed or stall, and how to refine your approach over time.

     From Zero to Heroes: Sales Xceleration Quickly Reaches 100th Advisor Milestone
One hundred Advisors and growing! What a ride it has been and continues to be. What a blessing it is to continue to grow our influential network. What an honor it is to work with these experienced, wise and talented outsourced sales management consultants. They inspire us; and we count them among our heroes for their commitment and dedication to servant leadership in the small to mid-sized business landscape. Here is a brief look at how Sales Xceleration started, where we are today, and where we are headed as we continue to expand and serve:
 
Inspiration, Discovery and Opportunity
Before the initial spark of inspiration that became Sales Xceleration, there was the discovery of a huge underserved business market. As longtime sales management and sales leadership professionals and collaborators, Mark Thacker and Chad Meyer uncovered a significant “sales leadership gap” in small and mid-sized businesses and decided to do something about it.
Early research indicated that in a typical U.S. metropolitan area, there were approximately 50,000 businesses with annual sales between $1m and $50m. Of those businesses, 80% lacked basic sales structures, processes and tools to effectively compete. And while Thacker and Meyer were serving such clients through their private sales consulting practices, they recognized it would take many additional seasoned sales executives to help close the overall gap. But they also recognized that many corporate sales executives were reluctant to make the jump to independent sales consulting because they lacked the tools and systems to “hit the ground running.”
This, then, became not merely a challenge – to help smaller businesses by first empowering sales management consultants – but also a purposeful mission.
After over a year of hard work, Thacker and Meyer developed sales management tools, systems and documentation – based on their own experience and expertise – that became the solid foundation for this new brand: Sales Xceleration.
You can imagine the complexity of the endeavor. Not only were they developing state-of-the-art sales consulting systems; they were also creating a new kind of business model – one designed to help other sales professionals create lives of fulfillment through “fractional time” consulting services for smaller businesses.
In 2013, the brand’s first marketing communications went out to prospective “Advisors.” Licensees came slowly at first, but as Sales Xceleration’s reputation grew, the company soon found its footing. In recent years, the growth has been exponential.
 
Today’s Sales Xceleration: 100 Heroes and Counting
Which brings us to the summer of 2019 when Sales Xceleration hit and surpassed this remarkable milestone: adding its 100th licensed Advisor to the team. Operating in 31 states and in Canada, these Advisors quickly became our heroes. Why? Many reasons…
Chad Meyer noted that “Our Advisors amaze me. They each took the bold, but measured step, to leave the corporate world and embark upon a life of balance and purpose for themselves, their spouses and children and their communities. When an Advisor tells me they took their kids or grandkids to school for the first time or transformed an owner’s business and saved countless jobs, I know that their sense of fulfillment is a result of their courage, dedication and determination.”
Thacker admires their entrepreneurial spirit and their commitment to servant leadership, too. It is something he values highly in step with his faith and his dedication to his family. “I do my best to walk a God-centered life; and my Mom and Dad were not only amazing parents, but role models I still try to emulate. Our Advisors share this same perspective. They, too, are heroes to me because of how they put their principles to work every day through servant leadership to clients.”
 
Expand and Serve: A Very Bright Future
As for the future of Sales Xceleration, look for the number of Advisors to continue to grow – as well as the number of geographic locations they serve.
Thacker said that, “Our service offerings and Advisor population have more than doubled in the last two years, and there are no signs of slowing down. We will continue to add Advisors in the U.S. at our current pace and we will also continue to add tools and software to assist our Advisors on the delivery of our services to their clients.”
International expansion is also “in the cards” according to Thacker. “We have considered many candidates from 5 continents (nobody from Antarctica yet!), but Canada made sense as the first international market. We anticipate rapid expansion in both Canada and the United Kingdom over the next few years.”
Both Co-founders agree: for Sales Xceleration, its Advisors and their clients, the future is very bright!
 
An Invitation
If you are a seasoned sales executive with a history of leadership and success, we’d like to get acquainted. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, we can help you hit the ground running. If you are a servant leader looking to lead a balanced life of fulfillment, you already have the mindset it takes to succeed as a licensed Sales Xceleration Outsourced VP of Sales. That’s “The Sales Xceleration Way;” and it has helped us earn recognition as one of Inc. Magazine’s “5,000 fastest-growing privately held companies in the U.S.” It also has helped us make a difference in countless lives and businesses. Won’t you join us?

     Actor and comedian Jim Carrey once gave a commencement speech imploring graduates to have courage to choose a path that would make a difference. Jim Carrey likely doesn’t jump to the top of your list when it comes to life advice, but it makes sense that a successful comedian must be a keen observer of the human condition and see possibilities the rest of us might miss. Regardless of your personal or faith-based perspectives, many points Carrey made in the speech are universal truths we tend to lose sight of when we live our lives to the expectations of others.
“Fear Disguised as Practicality”
During his humorous but inspiring speech, Carrey said: “You can spend your whole life…worrying about the pathway to the future” and ultimately choose your “path out of fear disguised as practicality.” While this might not be true for everyone, it surely is true for the great majority. Simply put, most people choose to toil in obscurity and the routine. But the harsh truth is this: few people make a difference when standing in the shadows. Only by stepping out of the darkness can you truly stand out. Carrey also said that “your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world.” Acceptance is a place of comfort. It is the ultimate comfort zone. By conforming to what others expect, demand (or will comfortably accept) from you, your life seemingly gets easier. It probably also becomes more mundane and less fulfilling. Carrey, on the other hand, encourages you to “risk being seen in all of your glory.”
“You Can Fail at What You Don’t Want”
It’s easy to heed the call of the naysayers and avoid risk altogether. After all, the simple choice is more often than not the one with few, if any, obstacles. But making any choice at all presents a risk of failure. And if that risk is ever-present regardless of the path you choose, why not choose the one that pushes you out of your comfort zone, to the greatest opportunity? Carrey shared the story of how his father could have been, like him, a great comedian. But his father took a “safer” route and became an accountant, an unsatisfying job he ultimately lost. Carrey relates that among the many things he learned from his father “was that you can fail at what you don’t want, so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.”
This is out of character for most people, of course, and Carrey laments that most of us believe “what we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect, so we never dare to ask the universe for it.” He took a different path and dared to ask for (and pursue) what he wanted. He risked being seen in all his glory, and today is making a difference for others.
“Perceive Challenges as Something Beneficial”
Jim Carrey has no delusions that choosing to stand out is easy. He knows that obstacles are ever-present. But he also related in that commencement speech that he is “making a conscious choice to perceive challenges as something beneficial” so he “can deal with them in the most productive way.” How you deal with challenges is ultimately up to you, but clearly Carrey believes it is better to deal with them with confidence in yourself, a bit of abandon, a positive attitude, and a visionary outlook.
“Doing Something Bigger”
A big part of being able to sustain a visionary outlook is to look beyond yourself – to dare to make a difference for others. That difference might start with making a better life for your family, but if you are like me, it doesn’t end there. You can start by looking at how your talents and your passions can positively impact others. For me, that introspection led me to create, with Chad Meyer, Sales Xceleration. It was more than merely finding a new way to provide for my family; it was a way to empower sales leadership professionals to use their skills and passions to help small to mid-sized businesses survive and thrive. Like Jim Carrey (but in a very different way, of course), I was committed to “going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself.” Today, we have over 150 Advisors helping businesses throughout North America. Better yet, as those businesses succeed, the owners and employees have livelihoods, and their families have a chance to prosper. I’m very thankful for that.
“The Most Valuable Currency”
One final thing Jim Carrey said really resonated: “The effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is.” This is a pretty powerful observation, but it’s also a challenge. To be able to increase your value, you need to make a difference for others. How do you do that? Where do you begin? For me it was a matter of moving toward what I love to do and away from what I hated doing. I took time to figure out the root of my enjoyment by looking at specific activities and tactics. This helped me to pinpoint what I enjoy most: mentoring, educating, teaching, and inspiring.
I also discovered what I didn’t like: navigating corporate bureaucracy, being away from family due to extensive traveling, and feeling that I was not being heard. From hundreds of discussions with other sales and leadership professionals, I now know that my love/hate list is often quite similar to theirs. This is only reinforced by our Sales Xceleration Advisors, who echo that they enjoy the hunt, the sense of achievement when a deal is done, and the satisfaction of being heard, feeling appreciated, and having the ability able to make a difference.
The Bottom Line:
Ultimately, Jim Carrey was reminding the audience that life is too short to not do what you love. However, you don’t have to start from scratch in order to follow a new path. In fact, any direction you decide to explore will allow you to utilize the wisdom you have gained through a lifetime of experiences. That puts you ahead of the game, reduces risk, and helps make it easier (and a little less scary) to follow Carrey’s lead and “take a chance on doing what you love.” In the end, the only way to know for sure if you can make a difference — for yourself, for your family, and for others — is to take the chance, face the challenges, and “be seen in all your glory.”

     If you think a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is only valuable for large corporations, think again. A good CRM, properly configured, can be an instrumental tool for helping small to mid-sized businesses gain market share and thrive even in a tight economy. Here’s how:
1. A CRM Can Improve Sales Efficiency
Although CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, it is valuable even before a true customer relationship begins. A well-designed and consistently utilized CRM can help smaller businesses establish and track the journey from first contact to conversion, and then on to managing the client account.
With a well-defined sales strategy and sales process in place, key prospect and customer relationship data can – and must – be added to your CRM. Of course, the CRM should also be configured to track prospect and customer interactions as they happen throughout the lifecycle of a relationship. In fact, a robust CRM can be used to document actions, events, and milestones throughout the buyer journey.
For the salesperson, the CRM becomes a linchpin for better sales efficiency and for tracking pipeline opportunities. It starts with being able to input these opportunities and adding notes about prospects in one place. This is critical because in extended sales cycles, months might pass between interactions. And with the CRM as a trusted repository of information, the salesperson can gauge the of quality of the lead, important prospect insights, and historical engagement data. This enables them to easily pick up where the last interaction left off. The CRM can also be a follow-through tool as well; it can help the sales rep remember what they promised to do and by what deadline.
The rep can also reference information about current sales pipeline and which step in the process they are at from demo to proposal to contract. This all adds up to less time wasted trying to recall key details – and less chance of embarrassment for getting those details wrong – when reconnecting with a prospect or an existing customer.
Finally, the CRM can help the sales rep understand where prospects are in the sales funnel in a way that helps the rep know when deals are likely to close and the impact on revenue and their commission. By tracking pipeline progress in real time, the sales rep can be better informed and more motivated to keep the process moving and to close those deals!
2. A CRM Can Improve Customer Service
Once a prospect becomes a customer, of course, the CRM can be an essential tool for tracking customer data and improving service. Customer-facing staff members should be authorized and equipped to utilize relevant areas of the CRM. This will keep the CRM up to date as continuing customer interactions occur. When the CRM is kept current in real time, each department that interacts with customers can see the big picture and more effectively manage their customer relationships.
When engaging with customers, it can be vital to customer satisfaction and loyalty for the service agent to be informed. During a customer call, for example, imagine the importance of being able to enter into the CRM the customer’s name and instantly accessing all their information in one place. Imagine, too, the competitive advantage that can give your company over a competitor that can’t match that attention to detail.
Service-oriented companies of any size are also wise to integrate email, messaging, and other forms of communication into the CRM. Properly configured with this capability, the customer can receive timely and relevant messages when appropriate, based on engagement activity and milestones.
3. A CRM Can Improve Overall Business Performance
Ultimately, the CRM will make it easier to analyze your company’s pipeline, revenue, processes, and assess your sales team’s overall productivity. For example, the CRM can help department managers stay fully informed and more efficient when meeting with employees and discussing prospect- and customer-related progress and performance.
To optimize a CRM for performance, it should be adaptable to changes in processes. It should be scalable, as well as fully capable of integrating and accepting new levels of prospect, customer, and process details. It should also be configurable to generate reports from macro to micro levels as necessary. But in the end, holding your team accountable for using the CRM is key to having clarity on overall performance of your sales team and the revenue impact they are driving for your business.
The Bottom Line:
A well-designed and thoughtfully implemented and maintained CRM can improve sales efficiency, enhance customer service, and give smaller businesses critical competitive advantages.

     If you think a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system is only valuable for large corporations, think again. A good CRM, properly configured, can be an instrumental tool for helping small to mid-sized businesses gain market share and thrive even in a tight economy. Here’s how:

Sales Leadership Training: Risks, Rewards and Significant ROI Impact

You Lost the Order – Don’t Make Things Worse by Losing the Connection

The Benefits of Outsourcing Your Sales Executive Function

12 Ways to Make Sure Your Vision Casting Makes Ripples


    ",structured sales leadership training programs,structured,insert_contextual_clause,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/top-4-sales-efficiency-challenges-and-solutions/,"
     The challenge of sales is that sales is, well, challenging! And when it comes to sales efficiency, four challenges seem particularly common. We often see small to mid-size businesses struggling in the areas of Sales Process Complexity, Sales Technology, Data and Analytics, and Sales Rep Training. Let’s dive into each category to evaluate the programs– and solutions – associated with each.
Sales Process Complexity
Common Problems:

Reduced efficiency and wasted effort due to sales reps spending too much time on administrative tasks
Longer sales cycles which can tie up resources and delay deal closings. Sometimes, this results from multiple decision-makers being required to sign off on the deal, but it too often results from inefficiencies in the seller’s organization.
Higher costs due to the extended sales cycles and the number of steps involved in the process
Customer frustration which can impact the seller/buyer relationship in the short- and long-term

Solutions to Consider:

Analyze the sales process to determine areas where the process can be streamlined or automated with AI
Create a sales playbook to ensure all sales team members truly understand the sales process
Hold the team accountable for understanding and following the documented process. If non-compliance is too common, it could indicate the process needs more fine-tuning.
Use technology to identify and generate leads, and use your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to identify recurring issues and bottlenecks
Listen to your customers; if they are frustrated with certain aspects of their buying experience, this should provide clues on how to improve your sales process

Sales Technology
Common Problems:

Too many tools and lack of coordination between technology platforms – including systems, software, and applications – can cause confusion and inefficiency for sales team members
Integration issues and lack of alignment can lead to data silos, repetitive and time-consuming input, overall inefficiencies, and conflicting output
Poor training that leaves sales reps underqualified to use sales technology effectively and efficiently
Utilizing technology platforms that the sales team does not buy into – they do not understand or see the value is provides, and therefore do not use it

Solutions to Consider:

Choose integrated or compatible technology systems to avoid compatibility problems
Provide thorough training to empower sales team members
Invest in a comprehensive (but not overly complex) CRM system
Implement a sales engagement platform to help automate repetitive tasks such as sending emails and scheduling meetings
Use sales analytics tools to help track performance and identify areas for improvement
Get feedback from your sales team members; as the frontline technology users, they probably have great ideas for enhancements


Lack of Data and Analytics
Common Problems:

Siloed data systems
Poor data collection practices, which can include not capturing key data in a CRM with each customer or prospect interaction
Poor data quality due to unreliable data sources, inaccurate data entry, duplicate data, or incomplete data
Lack of data analytics tools, often due to a lack of budget or a poor understanding of the importance of the tools and how to confidently use them

Solutions to Consider:

Improve data collection, whether it be from a purchased list or gathered during the course of business operations; strive for meaningful comprehensiveness that will support future reporting and forecasting
Centralize data in a well-aligned CRM system
Use meaningful data in the CRM to perform general sales analytics, forecasting, and process improvements
Use a consultant skilled in sales analysis to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for process improvement

Sales Rep Training
Common Problems:

Poor sales rep performance due to non-existent, poor, or improper sales training on processes, tools, and resources
High sales team turnover, which results from poor performance or dissatisfaction with upfront management support and professional development
Customer dissatisfaction due to poorly trained sales representatives
Poor sales training content that may be irrelevant, ineffective, or outdated
Lack of practice opportunities during and after sales training

Solutions to Consider:

Commit to frequent sales training and prioritize its importance even if it impacts available selling time in the short term
Implement sales training programs aligned to big-picture and specific sales performance needs
Listen to sales rep feedback to improve training methods and focus
Provide opportunities to practice what has been learned; use simulated and real-world opportunities, including roleplay

 The Bottom Line:
Identifying sales efficiency challenges is the first step toward implementing meaningful solutions. One easy way to identify your company’s unique problem areas is to take our free Sales Agility Assessment. It’s a quick and easy way to zero in on the challenges facing your sales organization. Once you have a better understanding of your specific sales challenges, focused solutions can be as close as a connection with a Sales Xceleration sales leadership consulting Advisor. You’ll find one in your area to help you overcome your most troubling sales efficiency challenges.

Five Things Top Sales Leaders Do Differently

Focus on Activity Management: Doing (and Measuring) the Right Things for Sales Success


    ",sales leadership training,,replace_existing_phrase,linked,
https://salesxceleration.com/whats-the-1-sales-challenge-for-smbs/,"
     Small to mid-sized businesses live and die by the performance of their sales organizations. After all, when sales efforts are effective and efficient, revenue and profit tend to escalate. On the other end of the spectrum, however, when sales efforts falter, revenues can plummet, margins can be razor thin, and the downturn can threaten the survival of the entire company. With so many potential problem areas, it can be incredibly difficult for companies to “go it alone” and zero in on solutions to their biggest challenges. The good news for struggling SMBs, however, is that an easy, yet robust sales assessment tool and data set of insights from thousands of similar businesses provides a launch pad for improvement.
Just what DOES the data show? What critical area represents the #1 sales challenge impacting North American SMBs (with annual revenues of $1M to $100M)? And what can be done to implement solutions right away? Read on…
Drumroll, Please…
The number one sales performance challenge for SMBs is … Sales Methodology. Huh? Sounds kind of broad, right? Let’s start by defining this key problem area:
Sales Methodology is the framework of principles, parameters, tools, and processes that empower your sales reps to close deals and convert prospects into customers.
For purposes of understanding the scope of the problem, we view Sales Methodology as encompassing these four essential components:

Territories
Coverage
Processes
Customer Relationship Management

It should be easy to see that falling short in any of these areas could handicap a sales organization and threaten company success. Just how big is the problem? Well, if you ask SMBs themselves (which we did, of course), it’s an enormous challenge. You see, at Sales Xceleration, we’ve analyzed data from SMB executives (one per company) who took our comprehensive Sales Agility Assessment (SAA) tool between 12/1/2018 and 12/31/2022. During that pre-engagement period, 3,686 clients self-reported their performance in key areas such as Sales Strategy, Sales Analysis, Sales Organization, and, of course, Sales Methodology. Of these, Sales Methodology and its essential components continues to rank as the most challenging problem. Naturally, therefore, if you can fix Sales Methodology, you’re well on your way to better sales performance.
The Sales Methodology Challenge
Obviously, a company cannot sell – or even plan – effectively if they lack a strategic sales methodology. This is even more problematic for companies with longer sales cycles because they must plan further in advance due to labor or supply chain challenges.
And yet, poor Sales Methodology performance is persistent and widespread. When it comes to effectiveness of their territories, coverage, processes, and customer relationship management, 93% of reporting company leaders admit their companies struggle. In fact, a full 80% of company leaders rate their Sales Methodology efforts as Poor. This 5% jump from the prior year means that, now, four in five leaders give their company the lowest rating possible. Another 13% rate their organizations as below average, with only 7% stating their companies are average or excellent in Sales Methodology. (It is important to remember that these figures are not Sales Xceleration’s interpretations, but rather, they are the self-reported assessments of SMB leaders who deal with the challenges inside-out and day after day.)

The Sales Methodology Solution
Addressing critical deficiencies in this area starts with a more in-depth analysis of the problems. The SAA is administered during initial discussions with a Sales Xceleration Advisor to help determine what processes are in place, what tools are being used, and how team members are performing.
For Sales Methodology, the key problem areas tend to be not having a CRM system, unclear sales processes, and lack of accountability for the sales team when carrying out sales processes. Eventual solutions, of course, address both big-picture and individual challenges in a way that recognizes the company’s unique economic landscape, marketplace, and internal culture.
The Sales Xceleration Opportunity
Subpar closing rates, falling revenue, and shrinking margins are often the catalyst for SMB executives to seek help. When they reach that point, when internal efforts continue to fall short, they turn to outside experts – experts like the Sales Xceleration Advisors who typically serve as fractional sales leadership consultants and often take the short-term role of Outsourced VP of Sales.
Our Advisors are sales leaders who have sought – and found – a more fulfilling and rewarding alternative to their corporate roles. They have been able to work with renewed passion and purpose as they serve SMBs in dire need of their experience, expertise, and sales leadership wisdom. Our ranks are growing quickly but opportunities exist in all North American markets.

In their former corporate careers, our Advisors have been fortunate to lead highly successful sales teams comprised of extremely hard-working and talented salespeople.  Because of this, they were the recipients of numerous leadership awards and accolades for their teams’ successes.  So what was their secret to leading a strong sales team that exceeded revenue goals?
In addition to hiring, training and managing their teams – the usual things a sales leader performs – there are 5 elements that should be implemented when building a successful sales team:
Transparency …
Take the extra time to explain the why, how and direction. When people understand the direction you’re headed, they’re more likely to jump on board with the plan. Too often, sales managers hold back on giving full instructions and insight. Consequently, their teams do not “buy in.” By giving people the full story, it allows them to understand the overall scheme.
Demand Feedback …
Transparency by itself is never enough. You must demand feedback. I’m not talking about asking for feedback as a gesture – but really demanding it. And then poke holes in the plan and make changes, if necessary. Don’t be afraid to make changes as a result of feedback.  Feedback and subsequent change is a good thing.  It gives your team ownership and an avenue to help make decisions.
Communicate Expectations …
This isn’t the time to play “Gotcha” management. Be clear in what you expect daily, weekly and monthly. And the same thing goes with projects. Lay out clear timelines and expectations. Again – feedback is good. Oftentimes teams will push themselves further when expectations are communicated clearly.
Don’t Hold Back …
Honest mistakes are okay, so don’t reprimand for mistakes that were done with good intentions. But when mistakes happen, address them immediately. Don’t let missteps linger without addressing them. Environments where people are comfortable making mistakes foster some of the most creative and productive settings you’ll ever work in.
Give Them Space …
This one is the hardest to do – and if you’re a new manager, probably the toughest thing to learn. People learn from doing a task themselves. There is growth in learning things on your own – and yes, at times making mistakes. But again, the job of a good sales leader is to give your team the space to develop as professionals.
Need help managing your team? Our Advisors can help. Our new Genesis+ product helps get your sales infrastructure in place and provides sales leadership training to deliver record breaking revenue.

This isn’t the time to play “Gotcha” management. Be clear in what you expect daily, weekly and monthly. And the same thing goes with projects. Lay out clear timelines and expectations. Again – feedback is good. Oftentimes teams will push themselves further when expectations are communicated clearly.
Don’t Hold Back …
Honest mistakes are okay, so don’t reprimand for mistakes that were done with good intentions. But when mistakes happen, address them immediately. Don’t let missteps linger without addressing them. Environments where people are comfortable making mistakes foster some of the most creative and productive settings you’ll ever work in.
Give Them Space …
This one is the hardest to do – and if you’re a new manager, probably the toughest thing to learn, strengthened through <a href=""https://salesxceleration.com/sales-leadership-training/""><strong>comprehensive sales leadership training</strong></a>. People learn from doing a task themselves. There is growth in learning things on your own – and yes, at times making mistakes. But again, the job of a good sales leader is to give your team the space to develop as professionals.
Need help managing your team? Our Advisors can help. Our new Genesis+ product helps get your sales infrastructure in place and provides sales leadership training to deliver record breaking revenue.

     Have you ever felt paralyzed when a door closes, perhaps a personal or professional door such as when a job or long-term career ends? It can be difficult to keep things in perspective and move on to greater opportunities, but perhaps the words of Helen Keller are a good starting place to find the proper focus:
“When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.”
Keller, a renowned disability rights advocate and author, included this version of the popular adage in her 1957 book, The Open Door. Of course, Keller did not merely repeat inspirational messages, she was (and continues to be) an inspiration for tens of millions. Blind and deaf from early childhood, she overcame challenges few of us can imagine, let alone conquer.
Over the course of her 87 remarkable years, Keller found strength and courage and motivation in knowing that when one door closes, another opens. So, when she spoke or wrote about possibilities and opportunities, it pays for us – still today – to listen and learn. Here’s what I mean:
 When One Door Closes…
The Keller adage has similar versions that have been attributed to Alexander Graham Bell, Miguel de Cervantes, and many others. It’s fair to say that it has entered the American lexicon of inspirational wisdom. Clearly, this metaphor can apply to many life and career situations. Whether it is a dream deferred, a personal relationship that ends, or a professional period that has run its course, doors close throughout our lives. What doors have closed for you recently? Can you foresee doors that might close soon? Perhaps your corporate career is coming to an end?
Keller’s point, of course, is that by dwelling on this closure and continuing to look back rather than forward, we can too easily miss what’s next (which might very well be more fulfilling than what we’ve just said goodbye to).
Another Door Opens
How many times have you lamented a loss – personal or professional – and felt unable to move past it? In the business world, the concept of “paralysis by analysis” refers to overanalyzing something to the point that you cannot move forward. While this can apply to strategic initiatives, marketing campaigns, product launches and the like, it might also be an apt characterization for the failure to move on. Certainly, if you’ve poured your heart and soul into something – your career, for example – it is natural to look back, to replay what might have gone wrong, to analyze what is a fait accompli, that is, something that has already happened, something unchangeable. The problem is that many people get stuck gazing at this unchangeable thing and turn what should be no more than a backward glance into a backward trance. And they miss the open door just over their shoulder. Such is the case with many sales leadership professionals who find themselves at the end of a successful career in corporate sales. They look back with pride, hopefully, but perhaps with some regret too. Dwelling too long in this misdirected state of focus, their next great sales career opportunity could remain hidden, even though it is easily within reach.
Will You Step Through to Opportunity?
I’ve written often about professional next chapters and second acts and second halves. I’ve written about how so many sales leaders whose corporate careers have ended believe at first that their only option is to ride off into the sunset or become cloaked in cobwebs as they sway gently in their rocking chair of regret.
But I’ve written, too, about how a great number of sales leaders have discovered a different path – a path that lies through that open door – to the world of fractional sales leadership consulting. No longer is an idle retirement a foregone conclusion. If you are like our Sales Xceleration licensed Advisors who provide outsourced sales solutions, you could be on the verge of using your hard-earned sales leadership wisdom to serve small to mid-size businesses as a sales leadership consultant in a role as an Outsourced VP of Sales. By stepping into this role, you provide the expert sales management consulting these companies urgently need to scale. Because it’s a fractional-time arrangement, you can serve multiple clients concurrently or choose how many hours you want to allocate to this next chapter. Regardless of how you decide to make your consulting opportunity work, you’ll almost certainly have this in common with our growing roster of licensed Advisors: you’ll work with a renewed sense of purpose and passion and find personal and professional fulfillment along with surprising financial reward possibilities.
The Bottom Line:
Every ending can be a new beginning. For every door that has closed, another opens. And your career sequel – your second act – could be more rewarding and fulfilling than your first.

     Sales Xceleration Launches New Certified Sales Leader Training Program 
That is Guaranteed to Pay for Itself!
 
Classes are led by proven Sales Leaders who average 25+ years of sales management experience 
 
INDIANAPOLIS, IN – November 13, 2018.  Sales Xceleration, the pioneer in providing outsourced sales leadership for small to mid-size businesses, announces the country’s most comprehensive sales leadership training program offered – the new Certified Sales Leader (CSL) designation! The CSL training program is for sales managers wanting to expand their skills and knowledge to become a sales leader who consistently drives their team to continued growth.
An untrained sales manager can cost a company money.  According to a recent study, over 54% of sales leaders have not had the proper training to effectively lead their team and develop the right processes and tools to meet their sales goals.  Most skilled professions require education or training to be effective in their roles, and sales leadership should be no different. That is why the CSL designation and certification program was created; we saw a gap in the market that needed to be filled to establish the gold standard for all sales leaders!
Training is conducted in person by an experienced VP of Sales who has, on average, over 25 years of sales leadership experience. They utilize their deep sales background and proven expertise to not only teach, but coach and consult.
Classes cover 16 lessons that educate on the entire sales management skill set, supplying needed sales processes, in addition to the tools to effectively implement change.  In order to become CSL certified, sales leaders must pass a comprehensive exam, ensuring they leave the class with the ability to practically apply their learnings for future success.
To kick off the launch, we are hosting multiple classes throughout the U.S. in early 2019.   All classes are taught by Sales Xceleration Advisors who are not only CSL certified, but also certified CSL trainers.  As of today, the current locations are:



Alpharetta, GA
Boston, MA
Charlotte, NC
Columbus, OH
Dallas, TX
Fort Lauderdale, FL
Fort Worth, TX
Greenville, SC
Hartford, CT
Houston, TX
Indianapolis, IN

“While assisting companies with their sales leadership needs, we saw a real need in the market to help develop future sales leaders.  So many sales leaders today were high performing sales reps who received a promotion – and they then find themselves managing a team and processes without any prior sales management experience.  We created this program to help businesses shape their sales leaders and provide the necessary skills and tools to exceed their company’s revenue targets,” Mark Thacker, President Sales Xceleration. This new certification is a perfect extension of our core focus on sales management consulting,

https://salesxceleration.com/7-things-to-measure-to-evaluate-sales-representative-performance/,"
     When assessing performance across sales representatives, some indicators of success are obvious. Who is driving the most revenue? Who is closing the most deals? But it is necessary to go beyond these traditional metrics in order to evaluate top performers as well as those who may require more support and training. Using the following indicators will allow you to have a clearer picture of how best to support your sales team and improve your bottom line.
Sales Revenue/Margin
This is perhaps the most obvious metric to track when evaluating the performance of a sales representative. By tracking the amount of revenue each representative brings in, you can get a sense of which reps are most effective at closing deals and driving business growth. It is also important to look at this number over time. Are they consistently on the top of the leader board? Do they maintain a high level of performance or did they have a good month/quarter/year? These are important questions to ask as you assess how to best support them in the future, to grow and drive even more business.
Number of Deals Closed
In addition to tracking overall revenue, it’s also important to pay attention to the number of deals that each representative is able to close. A rep who is able to close a large number of deals is likely doing a good job at building relationships with prospects and navigating the sales process effectively. They are efficiently making connections, meeting needs, and seeing each transaction through to fruition. Taking the total number of deals closed into account with a sales rep’s total sales revenue will present a holistic picture of their success.
Conversion Rate
Along with the number of deals closed, it’s important to look at the conversion rate for each rep. This metric measures the percentage of leads that a representative is able to turn into paying customers. A high conversion rate is a good sign that a rep is able to effectively qualify leads and close deals. It signifies they understand the market, your unique value proposition, and how to pivot for each client. Examining the conversion rate allows you to see exactly what each sales rep did with the opportunities they were given.
Average Deal Size
Tracking the average deal size for each rep can provide insight into which reps are able to secure larger contracts and drive more value for the company. It can also help identify reps who may be struggling to close larger deals. What are they missing? Looking at this metric will allow you to tailor training and support to increase deal size across the board.
Time to Close
The length of the sales cycle can vary depending on the complexity of the deal and the industry in which you operate. Tracking the average time it takes each rep to close a deal can help identify reps who may be struggling to move prospects through the sales process efficiently. Where are they getting hung up? What is slowing them down compared to their colleagues working on comparable deals? Again, examining this metric will help identify areas of improvement to be addressed, allowing you to improve the overall sales process.
Customer Satisfaction
In addition to tracking traditional sales metrics, it’s important to also consider the satisfaction of the customers that each rep is serving. Are their needs being met? Do they feel heard? Are they likely to provide a referral? By gathering feedback from customers and measuring satisfaction levels, you can get a sense of which reps are providing the best experience and building strong relationships with their clients.
Quality of Leads
Finally, it’s important to consider the quality of the leads that each rep is working on. If a rep is consistently working on high-quality leads that have a high likelihood of closing, it will be easier for them to achieve success. On the other hand, reps who are consistently working on lower-quality leads may struggle to achieve the same level of success, even if they are otherwise top performers. While lead generation and distribution can be handled differently across industries and markets, it is important for you to look at this metric concurrently with all others to have an accurate picture of sales performance.
Measuring the performance of sales representatives is crucial for any organization looking to drive growth and success, as it is one of the key sales management and leadership fundamentals. By tracking key metrics like sales revenue, number of deals closed, conversion rate, and customer satisfaction, you can get a clear picture of which reps are driving results and which may need additional support or training. In addition to these traditional metrics, it’s also important to consider factors like the average deal size and the quality of leads that each rep is working on. By taking a holistic view of sales representative performance, you can identify top performers and make strategic sales decisions to drive future success.

     In the wake of recent global shifts, it’s evident that sales management has transformed, leaving leaders and their teams with a unique set of challenges and opportunities to shape the future of their sales organization in a positive direction.
The Evolving Landscape of Sales Leadership
To thrive in the rapidly changing sales landscape, managers need to understand emerging trends that could help them lead and grow more efficiently.
1. Listen Before You Act
While the customer has always been king, sales teams often prioritized taking action before listening to buyer feedback. Post-pandemic, it’s crucial to shift this approach. Start by actively listening to your customers’ wants and needs before crafting your sales strategy. Gather insights, conduct surveys, and truly understand your target audience to tailor your approach effectively.
2. Foster Enhanced Collaboration
In addition to maintaining strong customer relationships, the future of sales management emphasizes the need for improved internal collaboration within your organization and throughout the supply chain. Encourage open communication, teamwork, and knowledge sharing among your teams to ensure a streamlined, customer-focused approach.
3. Cultivate Flexibility in Sales Leadership
To stay at the forefront of evolving sales trends, sales leaders must constantly adapt. To implement this, focus on being a quick learner, embracing technological advancements, and leading your team with purpose. Being open to change and ready to pivot your strategies when needed is the hallmark of a good leader.
Outsourced Sales Management: A Strategic Asset
Amid the rapid shifts following the pandemic, outsourcing sales management has emerged as a valuable tool for businesses. It’s not just a trend; it’s a strategic choice that can significantly impact the future of sales management. Here’s how outsourcing can benefit your business and boost your bottom line:
1. Stay Ahead of the Curve
Outsourcing to experienced professionals ensures your company doesn’t lag behind in adopting new trends. Outsourced sales leaders stay up to date with customer sentiments, priorities, and sales trends, giving you a competitive edge. By tapping into their expertise, you can build a resilient sales model that better serves your customers and drives higher profits.
2. Leverage Sales Expertise
Seasoned sales experts provide invaluable insights, strategies, and a deep understanding of the sales landscape that can be out of reach for smaller companies. Outsourced sales professionals bring a wealth of experience and specialized knowledge to the table, enabling small businesses to access top-tier talent and industry insights they might not be able to afford full-time.
3. Reduce Overhead Costs
Outsourcing can often be a cost-effective solution, especially for smaller businesses. You can scale your sales efforts up or down as needed, avoiding the burden of maintaining a full-time, in-house team during uncertain times.
The Bottom Line
Businesses can harness the power of outsourcing their sales function, a strategic move that can be especially beneficial when lacking the financial capacity for in-house leadership at the same level. By leveraging these experts, businesses can navigate complex sales challenges, stay competitive, and achieve revenue goals without the hefty costs of maintaining a full-time sales leadership team.
Are you seeking a strategic solution to navigate the evolving sales landscape? Would you like to tap into the expertise of seasoned sales leaders without the financial burden of a full-time team? As experienced professionals who understand the ever-changing sales trends, our Outsourced Advisors can help your business stay ahead of the curve. Don’t let the fast-paced sales world leave your business behind. Get in touch with your local Sales Xceleration Outsourced Advisor today and build a resilient sales model for tomorrow.

     Sales Xceleration Advisors recently convened in sunny Scottsdale, Arizona for our 2018 Annual Conference.  The Hotel Valley Ho in Old Scottsdale was an ideal location for the group of nearly 50 Advisors who attended, and the Valley of the Sun lived up to its reputation with beautiful weather!  While the location and amenities were superb, highlights of the 3-day event included the opportunity for Advisors to share best practices with one another, the introduction of new Advisor tools, and the reveal of an exciting new service for our client base.
Raising the Bar Higher was the theme of this year’s Conference – and we did just that!  Our Advisors are the best and brightest sales leaders in the country, and when given the opportunity to collaborate together and combine their 1,500+ years of sales leadership expertise, great things happen for the benefit of the clients we serve.
We are particularly excited about the introduction of our new product, Genesis+℠!  It is a powerful 16-week sales management training and certification program that builds and prepares sales leaders for rapid growth by combining the full suite of Sales Xceleration’s Genesis Sales Plan© (sales strategy, process, management, hiring) with expert sales leadership training, drawing from our deep expertise in sales management consulting. It provides exclusive one-on-one training with an Outsourced VP of Sales Advisor possessing an average of 25 years of sales leadership experience, giving business owners and their internal sales leaders the tools needed to implement and carry out a successful sales infrastructure and become better sales leaders.  Genesis+℠ was created as a result of client requests for Outsourced VP of Sales© Advisors to share their expertise and train an internal sales leader after the completion of successful Genesis Sales Plan© engagements.  Our upcoming newsletter, The Sales Xcelerator, will share additional details about Genesis+℠.
The Annual Conference continues to be a key benefit for Sales Xceleration Advisors.  It is a tremendous resource as they are able to leverage the depth of their peers’ expertise and knowledge in varied formats:

Advisor Success Stories were presented by John Lee (Portland, OR), Jay Greenwald (Denver, CO) and Joe Jackson (Columbus, OH). These presentations highlighted real-life client situations and detailed the before and after of their engagements.
In addition, informal roundtable discussions were held with questions/issues specific to Advisors and their engagements, discussed in depth, and then best practices were white boarded for the entire group.
Finally, a Panel Discussion was also conducted with Susan Tourville (Appleton, WI) and Michael Wills (Ft. Lauderdale, FL) serving as panelists.

While we gathered for the Annual Conference to share best practices, learn from each other, develop new friendships, reconnect, and discover what Sales Xceleration has planned for the future – the Agenda also contained social events for Advisors and their guests with a fun evening at Topgolf sponsored by Trident Contract Management and a starlit dinner on the Sky Line Rooftop at Hotel Valley Ho.
The 2018 Annual Conference was a huge success, in large part due to the active and enthusiastic participation of our Advisors. We are proud that every Sales Xceleration Advisor possesses unsurpassed executive sales leadership expertise and holds true to our Mission Statement:  Integrity, character and ethics, lived out in service for our clients.  To learn more about Sales Xceleration and the clients we serve, click here; or to find an Advisor near you, click here.

https://salesxceleration.com/active-listening-in-sales/,"
     Active listening is one of the most important skills in the salesperson’s toolbelt. Unfortunately, it is often overlooked and undervalued in the sales process. The result? Sales that should be easy instead become difficult. Sales efforts that can only lead to frustration – for the salesperson and the prospect – continue toward inevitable dead ends. And even when sales are made, the “solutions” sold might be off target, causing customer dissatisfaction and a damaged reputation for the selling organization.
By using active listening techniques, however, sales that might have been difficult become easier, dead-end prospects get weeded out early, and closed deals truly solve customer problems and ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.
So, let’s dig deeper into why active listening matters and how to use listening techniques to overcome objections, provide true solutions, and sell more!
 
The Problems of Selling Without Listening
Too often, salespeople launch into a standard sales pitch first and listen later – when it’s already too late. This is a classic case of selling instead of solving, of pressuring and pigeonholing a prospect into a one-size-fits-all solution that doesn’t fit at all and doesn’t solve their real need.
When a salesperson doesn’t listen first (and listen actively), it sends these unfortunate messages to the potential customer:

Solving their true needs or curing their real “pain” don’t really matter
Their needs are not unique and therefore their account won’t be managed based on its individual merits
The salesperson wants to make the sale as quickly as possible and move on to the next “conquest”
The salesperson’s needs exceed the prospective customer’s needs

This customer perception is very likely the reality. And it creates tension between salesperson and prospect, leading to wasted time and effort for both parties. If the inevitable protracted selling process does somehow result in a sale, chances are good that the solution sold doesn’t truly address what the customer needs. And that is the biggest problem of all because it frustrates the customer and damages the relationship with the selling organization.
 
The Benefits of Active Listening
On the other hand, when a salesperson utilizes active listening techniques, both parties benefit in several ways:

The prospect feels heard, respected and valued
The prospect may offer fewer and softer objections if the emphasis is on their need to solve a problem rather than the salesperson’s need to make a sale
The prospect has greater confidence that the solution bought will truly address their needs
The salesperson saves time and frustration by being able to understand if there is a true “fit” between the solution offered and what the prospect really needs
The salesperson gains a reputation as a trustworthy solution provider
The salesperson makes more sales in less time due to being able to quickly channel sales efforts to more qualified targets

 
How to Use Active Listening in Your Selling Process
So, with the benefits of active listening clear for both buyer and seller, how can the smart salesperson use active listening to overcome objections and sell more (and more efficiently)? Here are some basic active listening techniques:

Listen with your eyes. Maintain eye contact to establish and keep a better communication connection with the prospect.
Be aware of body language. Adopt an “open” listening posture. Lean in as you listen. Nod to express understanding. Smile. Don’t cross your arms or legs in a defensive, “closed up” manner.
Avoid the temptation to interrupt. Don’t interject features and benefits of your product or service while the prospect is explaining their need. There will be time to describe your solution later – if it really is the solution the prospect needs.
Don’t just hear the words, but truly listen for their underlying meaning.
Take notes. This tells the prospect that you want to get the details right.
Repeat for understanding. Periodically during the conversation, say, “Let me make sure I understand what you’re saying,” and then repeat a key point the prospect has just expressed. Validating understanding shows a high level of concern and care.
Ask questions when necessary for clarification. Although frequent interruptions should be avoided, if you are truly unclear about something the prospect has said, ask for clarification. Just avoid the temptation to piggyback that clarification with a premature sales pitch.

The Bottom Line:
Zig Ziglar once said, “You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.” To help prospects get what they want, you must understand their needs. To gain this understanding, use active listening. This technique can strengthen the bond between salesperson and customer. It can ensure that solutions address real needs and lead to greater customer satisfaction. And above all, it can boost sales in two ways: 1) it qualifies prospects earlier in the sales process, and 2) it leads to more efficient selling with less time wasted overcoming objections. Ultimately, active listening benefits both the buyer and the seller – especially when used to discover alignment between the buyer’s needs and how your product or service solutions address those needs.
If you’re not sure your sales team members are fully skilled in active listening, one of Sales Xceleration’s outsourced sales management consulting Advisors can help. We can assess your team’s active listening skills, along with analyzing your entire sales organization, all to sell more with less effort.
