# Parenting Plan Mediation in Arizona

**Create a Stable Future for Your Children with a Custom Parenting Plan**

Establishing a parenting plan is one of the most critical aspects of divorce or separation involving children. In Arizona, the courts require a comprehensive parenting plan that outlines how parents will share decision-making responsibilities and parenting time. At The Aurit Center for Divorce Mediation, we help you create a thoughtful, detailed parenting plan that prioritizes your children's well-being and minimizes future conflict.

## How Arizona Law Supports Parenting Plan Mediation

Arizona law encourages families to resolve parenting matters peacefully. Under **Arizona Revised Statutes § 25-403**, the state prioritizes the "best interests of the child," recognizing that collaborative agreements often serve children better than court-imposed orders. Mediation allows parents to reach their own settlement outside the courtroom.

Mediation agreements that meet Arizona’s requirements can be submitted to the court and entered as legally binding orders. Communications during mediation are protected under **Rule 67.3 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure**, meaning your discussions remain confidential.

## Why Arizona Courts Encourage Mediation

Arizona judges often recommend or order mediation before a custody trial under **Rule 68 of the Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure**. State policy promotes mediation to:

### Reduce Congestion
Reduces court congestion and lowers costs to taxpayers by keeping cases out of the system.

### Support Cooperation
Supports cooperation between parents specifically for the benefit and well-being of children.

### Honor Agreements
Fosters agreements that families are more likely to honor because they created them together.

### Decrease Conflict
Decreases post-divorce conflict and minimizes the need for repeated court motions.

## Legal Benefits of Mediation vs. Litigation

Arizona family courts strongly favor mediation for its positive outcomes. Here’s how it compares:

| Legal Factor | Mediation | Litigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Privacy** | Confidential; not public record | Filed and argued publicly in court |
| **Control** | You decide the terms | Judge decides outcomes |
| **Timeline** | Usually 2–4 months | Often 12 months or more |
| **Cost** | Flat-fee pricing | High retainers & hourly fees |
| **Compliance** | Parents likely to follow own terms | Lower likelihood of following orders |

## Developing a Comprehensive Parenting Plan

Our experienced mediators guide you through every detail to ensure your plan is robust and practical. We assist you in addressing:

### 1. The Regular Parenting Schedule
We help you design a routine that provides stability for your children and fits your work and lifestyle. Whether it's a 5-2-2-5, week-on/week-off, or a custom schedule, we find what works best for you.

### 2. Holidays and Vacations
Holiday schedules often supersede the regular routine. We help you proactively plan for major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas/Hanukkah, etc.), school breaks, and family vacations to avoid last-minute stress.

### 3. Decision-Making Authority
We facilitate agreements on how you will make significant decisions. Most clients in mediation choose **Joint Legal Decision-Making**, where parents consult and agree on major issues, but we can structure this to fit your specific circumstances.

### 4. Transition & Logistics
The small details matter. We help you define how exchanges will occur, who provides transportation, and how to handle children's belongings, ensuring smooth transitions between homes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between Legal Decision-Making and Parenting Time in Arizona?
In Arizona, **Legal Decision-Making** refers to the authority to make major non-emergency decisions for a child, such as education, health care, and religious training. **Parenting Time** (formerly visitation) refers to the actual schedule of when the child is physically with each parent. Most mediated plans result in *Joint Legal Decision-Making*, where parents share this authority equally.

### Is a mediated parenting plan legally binding in Arizona?
Yes. Once your mediated parenting plan is signed by both parents and submitted to the court, it becomes a **legally binding court order**. This means both parents are legally obligated to follow the schedule and terms outlined in the plan, just as if a judge had decided it after a trial.

### What happens if my co-parent violates the parenting plan?
If a parent consistently violates the court-ordered parenting plan (e.g., withholding parenting time), you have legal recourse. You can file a petition to enforce the order with the court. Mediation also allows you to include specific **dispute resolution** clauses, requiring you to return to mediation or arbitration to resolve disagreements before filing new court motions.

### Can we modify our parenting plan if our schedule changes?
Yes, parenting plans in Arizona can be modified. If both parents agree to the changes (e.g., a new job requires a schedule shift), you can easily submit a stipulation to modify the existing order. If parents cannot agree, they may return to mediation to negotiate the new terms rather than litigating the modification in court.

### Do children have a say in the parenting plan in Arizona?
Arizona law requires the court to consider the wishes of the child, **depending on the child's age and maturity**. While there is no specific age where a child can "choose," their preferences can be a factor. In mediation, parents often discuss how to appropriately consider their child's input without placing the burden of choice directly on them.
