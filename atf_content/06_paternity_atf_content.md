**Tagline:** Experienced Florida Paternity Lawyers

**Headline:** Our experienced *Florida paternity attorneys* focus on helping parents establish legal parentage with confidence and care.

### Intro Content

Legal paternity matters because it determines a father's rights and responsibilities. Without established paternity, a father has no legal right to custody or time-sharing with his child. Similarly, a child cannot receive child support, inheritance rights, or benefits from their father without legal paternity.

At **Vasquez de Lara Law Group**, we handle both sides of paternity cases—helping fathers establish their legal rights and helping mothers secure the support their children deserve. We guide you through DNA testing, court filings, and all related custody and support issues.
