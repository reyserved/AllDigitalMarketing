### Intro Content

In Florida, "visitation" is typically called time-sharing, and it's a critical component of any parenting plan. When parents separate or divorce, ensuring that both parents maintain meaningful, consistent contact with their children is essential for the children's well-being.

At **Vasquez de Lara Law Group**, we help parents establish fair time-sharing schedules, modify existing arrangements when circumstances change, and enforce orders when the other parent isn't complying. Your relationship with your children matters—we fight to protect it.
