**Headline:** Our experienced *Florida equitable distribution attorneys* focus on helping clients navigate asset division with confidence and care.

### Intro Content

Florida is an "equitable distribution" state, meaning marital assets and debts are divided fairly—but not necessarily equally. The court considers numerous factors including the length of the marriage, each spouse's economic circumstances, and contributions to the marriage (including homemaking and child-rearing).

At **Vasquez de Lara Law Group**, we meticulously identify, value, and categorize all assets—from real estate and retirement accounts to business interests and hidden assets. We fight to ensure you receive your fair share of the marital estate you helped build.
