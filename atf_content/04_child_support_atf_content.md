### Intro Content

Every child deserves financial security, regardless of their parents' relationship status. Florida uses a specific formula based on both parents' incomes and the amount of overnight time each parent has with the children. But the process is rarely as simple as plugging numbers into a calculator.

At **Vasquez de Lara Law Group**, we help parents on both sides of child support—whether you're seeking to establish support, need to modify an existing order due to changed circumstances, or are dealing with a parent who isn't paying what they owe. We ensure your children's financial needs are met.
