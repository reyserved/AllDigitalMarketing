### Intro Content

The transition from a two-income household—or a household where one spouse supported the other—to a single income is one of the most frightening aspects of divorce. You are likely asking yourself how you will pay the mortgage, maintain your lifestyle, or even cover basic expenses once the divorce is final.

At **Vasquez de Lara Law Group**, we understand that these fears are valid. Financial independence is the goal, but the bridge to get there often requires support. We help clients navigate the complexities of spousal support in Florida, ensuring that the contributions you made to your marriage are recognized and your financial future is protected.
