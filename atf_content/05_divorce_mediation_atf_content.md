### Intro Content

Not every divorce needs to end in a courtroom battle. Mediation offers a more collaborative path—one where you and your spouse work together with a neutral third party to reach agreements on property division, custody, and support. Florida courts prioritize mediation, often requiring it before a case can proceed to trial.

At **Vasquez de Lara Law Group**, we guide clients through this process with strategic insight, ensuring that any agreement you reach protects your interests while avoiding the high costs and emotional toll of litigation.

### Benefits of Mediation

- **Cost-Effective** — Significantly lower than litigation
- **Faster Resolution** — Avoid lengthy court delays
- **Confidential** — Private negotiations, not public record
- **You Maintain Control** — Parties decide, not a judge
