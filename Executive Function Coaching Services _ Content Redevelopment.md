Achieve Your Goals with Confidence

# **Executive Function Coaching Services**

Executive function skills are the brain's management system \- they help us plan, organize, focus, and follow through. When these skills lag behind our intelligence or ambitions, life can feel overwhelming.

At New Frontiers, we provide **executive function coaching** designed to help you or your child build the practical skills needed for success in school, career, and life. **You do not need a diagnosis to benefit**; you just need a desire to improve.

## **What is Executive Function Coaching?**

Executive Function (EF) coaching is a personalized, practice-driven process focused on *how you get things done*.  
It is **not tutoring** (subject re-teaching) and **not therapy** (emotional processing). We build systems and habits that make learning and working *work*.

What happens in coaching

* **Identify** specific bottlenecks in their daily execution.  
* **Develop** personalized strategies using their unique strengths.  
* **Practice** these strategies in real-world situations until they become habits.

**Core skills you’ll build**

* Planning & time management  
* Task initiation & follow-through  
* Organization (digital \+ physical)  
* Focus & attention control  
* Cognitive flexibility & emotional regulation

Whether you are a student facing academic pressure or an adult managing a complex career, coaching bridges the gap between **knowing** what to do and actually **doing** it.

## **Who We Help: Tailored Pathways**

We recognize that the challenges of a 10th grader are vastly different from those of a corporate manager. Our coaching is specialized by age and life stage.

### **For Students**

#### **Build Independence, Focus, and Academic Confidence**

School requires more than just intelligence; it requires managing assignments, tracking due dates, and studying effectively. We help students ranging from elementary to post-secondary build the structure they need to succeed without constant parental supervision.

* **Ideal for**: Students with missing assignments, disorganization, exam anxiety, or trouble starting tasks.  
* **Outcome**: A more confident, independent learner who can advocate for themselves.

### **For Adults**

#### **Regain Prioritization, Productivity, and Work-Life Balance**

Adult life demands high-level management of career, household, and personal goals. When executive functions are overtaxed, it leads to burnout and dropped balls. We partner with professionals, parents, and adults in transition to streamline their responsibilities.

* **Ideal for**: Adults feeling "stuck," overwhelmed by to-do lists, chronically late, or struggling to balance work and home.  
* **Outcome**: Improved productivity, reduced stress, and a clear system for managing daily life.
