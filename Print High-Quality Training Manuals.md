Printed Training Materials Frequently Asked Questions

Is there a minimum or maximum quantity you typically print?  
Because we work with customers to help optimize their print runs to meet demand while securing the best cost-per-piece and minimizing unnecessary overhead or waste, our threshold is based on a total annual print run quantity, not on just a single print run. As a general rule of thumb, our customers print a minimum of a few hundred booklets (manuals, workbooks, course books, etc.) annually, and can produce up to tens of thousands in a year. In some cases, that annual volume is made up of just one piece or title, while other customers have an extensive training library consisting of hundreds of different titles.

My course is being delivered virtually. Can you deliver printed materials to individuals?  
Absolutely\! We work with you on delivery options to support both in-person and virtual classes and workshops. This includes any combination of bulk shipment to one or several on-site locations and delivery to individual participants at their homes or offices.

Can you help me with other course materials such as pens or other premium items?  
Of course\! We can print, assemble, and ship participant kits to a centralized site, to individual attendees, or a combination of both. These kits can include items for the course, such as pens, highlighters, Post-it® Notes, completion certificates, and more. You can also include promotional materials to advertise other courses, programs, or publications. Take it a step further and include premium items that bring your brand to life and support virtual learners at home, such as stress balls, fidgets, travel mugs, and more. For any materials that we are not producing in-house, simply ship them to us and we’ll include them with everything else.

Can I send you materials to include in my kits?  
Yes\! You’re welcome to ship us materials you’d like included in your kits—whether that’s branded items like mugs, stress balls, or pens, or printed materials like certificates, flyers, or product inserts. Our team will coordinate the assembly to make sure everything is packed together correctly and professionally.

I’m holding several different classes over the course of a year. Can you store and ship my materials on an as-needed basis?  
In addition to print, we also offer warehousing and inventory management services. We’ll work with you to determine the right amount of books to print and inventory that meets forecasted demand, without over- or under-printing. And getting started is easier than ever with our simple 5-step process.

Forecasting demand for course materials has become more difficult for several reasons. How can I still make sure I’m printing the right quantity at the right cost?  
Not to worry\! There are many situations that cause demand forecast to be difficult—from launching a new course to changes in program delivery due to a global pandemic. We provide several options to provide greater flexibility with your print runs.

Our organization is seeking proposals for a print provider. Where should I send the RFP?  
We’d love to be included in your RFP process. Send your proposal to: JustAsk@omnipress.com, and our team will follow up promptly.
