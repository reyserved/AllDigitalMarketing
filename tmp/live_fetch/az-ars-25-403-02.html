<p>A. If the child's parents cannot agree on a plan for legal decision-making or parenting time, each parent must submit a proposed parenting plan.</p>

<p>B. Consistent with the child's best interests in section 25-403 and sections 25-403.03, 25-403.04 and 25-403.05, the court shall adopt a parenting plan that provides for both parents to share legal decision-making regarding their child and that maximizes their respective parenting time. The court shall not prefer a parent's proposed plan because of the parent's or child's gender.</p>

<p>C. Parenting plans shall include at least the following: </p>

<p>1. A designation of the legal decision-making as joint or sole as defined in section 25-401.</p>

<p>2. A description of each parent's rights and responsibilities for the personal care of the child and for decisions in areas such as education, health care and religious training.</p>

<p>3. A practical schedule of parenting time for the child, including holidays and school vacations.</p>

<p>4. A procedure for the exchanges of the child, including location and responsibility for transportation.  The parenting plan must specify when the exchange is required to take place at a safe exchange location pursuant to section 25-403.10.</p>

<p>5. A procedure by which proposed changes, relocation of where a child resides with either parent pursuant to section 25-408, disputes and alleged breaches may be mediated or resolved, which may include the use of conciliation services or private counseling.</p>

<p>6. A procedure for periodic review of the plan's terms by the parents.</p>

<p>7. A procedure for parents to communicate with each other about the child, including methods and frequency.</p>

<p>8. A statement that each party has read, understands and will abide by the notification requirements of section 25-403.05, subsection B.</p>

<p>D. If the parents are unable to agree on any element to be included in a parenting plan, the court shall determine that element. The court may determine other factors that are necessary to promote and protect the emotional and physical health of the child.</p>

<p>E. Shared legal decision-making does not necessarily mean equal parenting time. </p>
