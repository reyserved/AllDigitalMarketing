<p>Prior to the filing of any action for annulment, dissolution of marriage, or legal separation, either spouse, or both spouses, may file in the conciliation court a petition invoking the jurisdiction of the court for the purpose of preserving the marriage by effecting a conciliation between the parties or for amicable settlement of the controversy between the spouses so as to avoid further litigation over the issue involved. In any case where an action for annulment, dissolution of marriage, or legal separation has been filed, either party thereto may by petition filed therein have the cause transferred to the conciliation court for proceedings in the same manner as though action had been instituted in the conciliation court in the first instance. </p>
